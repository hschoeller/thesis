  abstract = {Persistent dry and wet spells can arise from stationary weather situations or recurrent flow patterns and result in significant socio-economic impacts. Here, we study the effects of recurrent synopticscale transient Rossby wave packets (RRWPs) on the persistence of dry and wet spells using the ERAInterim reanalysis data. RRWPs significantly alter (decrease and increase) dry and wet spell persistence across the globe. Spatial patterns of statistically significant links between RRWPs and spell durations arise from the superposition of a zonally symmetric component and a wave-like component that is modulated by local factors such as orography and the position relative to major moisture sources. The zonally symmetric component is apparent during the Northern Hemisphere winter and dominates the Southern Hemisphere signal in winter and summer. The wave-like component appears primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, changes its wavenumber with the season and is thus, conceivably related to stationary wave dynamics.},

We present a review of four approaches and demonstrate the utility of these methods via their application to the same sample analytic model, the canonical double-gyre flow, highlighting the pros and cons of each approach. Two of the methods, the geometric and probabilistic approaches, are well established and require velocity field data over the time interval of interest to identify particularly important material lines and surfaces, and influential regions, respectively. The other two approaches, implementing tools from cluster and braid theory, seek coherent structures based on limited trajectory data, attempting to partition the flow transport into distinct regions. All four of these approaches share the common trait that they are objective methods, meaning that their results do not depend on the frame of reference used. For each method, we also present a number of example applications ranging from blood flow and chemical reactions to ocean and atmospheric flows.},

Even though the low temperatures of January 2017 did not break previous low records for all stations, the long duration was quite extreme, resulting in strong socioeconomic impacts in the region of interest. The 10-year to 100-year return values of minimum temperatures were calculated based on block maxima method and the maximum likelihood estimates. The estimated return periods of the absolute minimum temperature are approximately 15 or 20 years for almost all stations. For only one station, the absolute minimum temperature of January 2017 might happen once in every 300 years according to the return level results. Moreover, the extreme cold episode over the Balkans during the period of 5 January 2017 to 12 January 2017 was associated with a significant outbreak of arctic air masses into eastern–central Europe and the Balkans and a cutoff low at the level of 500 hPa over the region.},

This study evaluates winter subseasonal reforecasts delivered by the CNRM and ECMWF dynamical systems and identifies that the level of skill for predicting temperature in Europe varies fairly consistently in both systems. In particular, forecasts initialized during positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phases tend to be more skillful over Europe at week 3 in both systems. Composite analyses performed in an atmospheric reanalysis, a long-term climate simulation and both forecast systems unveil very similar temperature and sea-level pressure patterns 3 weeks after NAO conditions. Furthermore, regressing these fields onto the 3-weeks-prior NAO index in a reanalysis shows consistent patterns over Europe but also other regions of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, thereby suggesting a lagged teleconnection, related to either the persistence or recurrence of the positive and negative phases of the NAO. This teleconnection, conditioned to the intensity of the initial NAO phase, is well captured by forecast systems. As a result, it is a key mechanism for determining a priori confidence in the skill of wintertime subseasonal forecasts over Europe as well as other parts of the Northern Hemisphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Latent heating modifies the jet stream by modifying the vertical geostrophic wind shear, thereby altering the potential for baroclinic development. Hence, correctly representing diabatic effects is important for modelling the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation and variability. However, the direct effects of diabatic heating remain poorly understood. For example, there is no consensus on the effect of latent heating on the cross-jet temperature contrast. We show that this disagreement is attributable to the choice of spatio-temporal averaging. Jet representations relying on averaged wind tend to have the strongest latent heating on the cold flank of the jet, thus weakening the cross-jet temperature contrast. In contrast, jet representations reflecting the two-dimensional instantaneous wind field have the strongest latent heating on the warm flank of the jet. Furthermore, we show that latent heating primarily occurs on the warm flank of poleward directed instantaneous jets, which is the case for all storm tracks and seasons.},

Historical simulations and two future scenarios, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, are considered. The models are evaluated against the reanalysis, and only a subset of climate models, which better represent the blocking weather regime in the recent-past climate, is considered for the analysis. We show that the spatio-temporal characteristics of recent-past atmospheric blocking are in agreement with previous studies that define blocking events with blocking indexes. We find that frequency and duration of blocking events remain relatively stationary over the 21st century. We define a methodology that relies on the WTD for the blocking event identification in order to quantify the size of the blocking events, and we find that the blocking size is basically unchanged in the future.},

We introduce a method to identify time-parameterized families of almost-invariant sets in time-dependent dynamical systems, as well as the families’ emergence and disappearance. In contrast to coherent sets, which may freely move about in phase space over time, our technique focuses on families of metastable sets that are quasi-stationary in space. Our straightforward approach extends successful transfer operator methods for almost-invariant sets to time-dependent dynamics and utilizes the Ulam scheme for the generator of the transfer operator on a time-expanded domain. The new methodology is illustrated with an idealized fluid flow and with atmospheric velocity data. We identify atmospheric blocking events in the 2003 European heatwave and compare our technique to existing geophysical methods of blocking diagnosis.},

In this companion paper, we consider practical issues for the empirical applications of the procedures. We first address the problem of estimation of the break dates and present an efficient algorithm to obtain global minimizers of the sum of squared residuals. This algorithm is based on the principle of dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares operations of order O T2 for any number of breaks. Our method can be applied to both pure and partial structural change models. Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence intervals for the break dates under various hypotheses about the structure of the data and the errors across segments. Third, we address the issue of testing for structural changes under very general conditions on the data and the errors. Fourth, we address the issue of estimating the number of breaks. Finally, a few empirical applications are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the procedures. All methods discussed are implemented in a GAUSS program.

Limiting distributions are also derived. Unlike simultaneous estimation, the limiting distributions are generally not symmetric and are influenced by regression parameters of all regimes. A simple method is introduced to obtain break point estimators that have the same limiting distributions as those obtained via simultaneous estimation. Finally, a procedure is proposed to consistently estimate the number of breaks.},

The asymptotic distribution for the change point estimator is obtained when the magnitude of shift is small. It is shown that serial correlation affects the variance of the change point estimator via the sum of the coefficients of the linear process. When the underlying process is autoregressive moving average, a mean shift causes overestimation of its order. A simple procedure is suggested to mitigate the bias in order estimation.},

Our method can be seen as an extension of diffusion maps to trajectory space, and it allows us to construct “dynamical coordinates,” which reveal the intrinsic lowdimensional organization of the data with respect to transport. The only a priori knowledge about the dynamics that we require is a locally valid notion of distance, which renders our method highly suitable for automated data analysis. We show convergence of our method to the analytic transfer operator framework of coherence in the infinite data limit and illustrate its potential on several twoand three-dimensional examples as well as real world data.},

  abstract = {Variational and ensemble methods have been developed separately by various research and development groups and each brings its own benefits to data assimilation. In the last decade or so, various ways have been developed to combine these methods, especially with the aims of improving the background‐error covariance matrices and of improving efficiency. The field has become confusing, even to many specialists, and so there is now a need to summarize the methods in order to show how they work, how they are related, what benefits they bring, why they have been developed, how they perform, and what improvements are pending. This article starts with a reminder of basic variational and ensemble techniques and shows how they can be combined to give the emerging ensemble‐variational (EnVar) and hybrid methods. A key part of the article includes details of how localization is commonly represented.             There has been a particular push to develop four‐dimensional methods that are free of linearized forecast models. This article attempts to provide derivations of the formulations of most popular schemes. These are otherwise scattered throughout the literature or absent. It builds on the nomenclature used to distinguish between methods, and discusses further possible developments to the methods, including the representation of model error.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

  abstract = {Synoptic-scale error growth near the tropopause is investigated from a process-based perspective. Following previous work, a potential vorticity (PV) error tendency equation is derived and partitioned into individual contributions to yield insight into the processes governing error growth near the tropopause. Importantly, we focus here on the further amplification of preexisting errors and not on the origin of errors. The individual contributions to error growth are quantified in a case study of a 6-day forecast. In this case, localized mesoscale error maxima have formed by forecast day 2. These maxima organize into a wavelike pattern and reach the Rossby wave scale around forecast day 6. Error growth occurs most prominently within the Atlantic and Pacific Rossby wave patterns. In our PV framework, the error growth is dominated by the contribution of upper-level, near-tropopause PV anomalies (near-tropopause dynamics). Significant contributions from upper-tropospheric divergent flow (prominently associated with latent heat release below) and lower-tropospheric anomalies [tropospheric-deep (i.e., baroclinic) interaction] are associated with a misrepresentation of the surface cyclone development in the forecast. These contributions are, in general, of smaller importance to error growth than near-tropopause dynamics. This result indicates that the mesoscale errors generated near the tropopause do not primarily project on differences in the subsequent baroclinic growth, but instead directly project on the tropopause evolution and amplify because of differences in the nonlinear Rossby wave dynamics.},

  abstract = {This study provides a process-based perspective on the amplification of forecast uncertainty and forecast errors in ensemble forecasts. A case from the North Atlantic Waveguide and Downstream Impact Experiment that exhibits large forecast uncertainty is analysed. Two aspects of the ensemble behaviour are considered: (a) the mean divergence of the ensemble members, indicating the general amplification of forecast uncertainty, and (b) the divergence of the best and worst members, indicating extremes in possible error-growth scenarios. To analyse the amplification of forecast uncertainty, a tendency equation for the ensemble variance of potential vorticity (PV) is derived and partitioned into the contributions from individual processes. The amplification of PV variance is, on average for the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, dominated by near-tropopause dynamics. Locally, however, other processes can dominate the variance amplification, for example, in the region where tropical storm Karl interacts with the Rossby-wave pattern during extratropical transition. In this region, the variance amplification is dominated by upper-tropospheric divergence and tropospheric–deep interaction and is thereby mostly related to (moist baroclinic) cyclone development. The differences between the error growth in the best and worst ensemble members can, to a large part, be attributed to differences in the representation of cut-off evolution around 3 days, which subsequently amplifies substantially in the highly nonlinear region of the Rossby-wave pattern until 5 days. In terms of the processes, the differences in error growth are dominated by differences in the error growth by near-tropopause dynamics. The approach presented provides flow-dependent insight into the dynamics of forecast uncertainty and forecast errors and helps to understand better the different contributions of specific weather systems to the medium-range amplification of ensemble spread.},

  abstract = {Two diagnostics based on potential vorticity and the envelope of Rossby waves are used to investigate upscale error growth from a dynamical perspective. The diagnostics are applied to several cases of global, real-case ensemble simulations, in which the only difference between the ensemble members lies in the random seed of the stochastic convection scheme. Based on a tendency equation for the enstrophy error, the relative importance of individual processes to enstrophy-error growth near the tropopause is quantified. After the enstrophy error is saturated on the synoptic scale, the envelope diagnostic is used to investigate error growth up to the planetary scale. The diagnostics reveal distinct stages of the error growth: in the first 12 h, error growth is dominated by differences in the convection scheme. Differences in the upper-tropospheric divergent wind then project these diabatic errors into the tropopause region (day 0.5–2). The subsequent error growth (day 2–14.5) is governed by differences in the nonlinear near-tropopause dynamics. A fourth stage of the error growth is found up to 18 days when the envelope diagnostic indicates error growth from the synoptic up to the planetary scale. Previous ideas of the multiscale nature of upscale error growth are confirmed in general. However, a novel interpretation of the governing processes is provided. The insight obtained into the dynamics of upscale error growth may help to design representations of uncertainty in operational forecast models and to identify atmospheric conditions that are intrinsically prone to large error amplification.},

Three model configurations differing in the treatment of shallow convection were used to explore the impact on process tendencies, weather forecasts and climate simulations. In the summary of this work presented here, special emphasis is put on the interaction of processes and the altered balance between processes when a physical parameterization is removed, or replaced by a conceptually different approach to the treatment of shallow convection. The activities related to boundary layer clouds that took place at ECMWF in the past few years also revealed that at present there are several inconsistencies between the parameterizations contributing to the representation of cloudy boundary layers. These inconsistencies are listed here, and a strategy towards a more consistent description of moist boundary layers is introduced. Finally, a first attempt to harmonize the computation of convective cloud base and subcloud properties across the shallow convection scheme and the turbulent diffusion scheme is described.},

We generalize these findings by documenting similar effects with data from a weekly opinion poll and a large-scale panel survey. We provide further evidence that poor air quality leads to more negative emotions such as anger, worry, and unhappiness, which, in turn, may reduce the support for the political status quo. Overall, these results suggest that poor air quality affects decision-making in the population at large, including consequential political decisions.},

The number of observations assimilated increases from 53,000 per day in early 1950 to 570,000 per day by the end of 1978. Accordingly, the quality of the reanalysis improves throughout the period, generally joining seamlessly with the segment covering 1979 to the present. The fidelity of the extension is illustrated by the accurate depiction of the North Sea storm of 1953, and the events leading to the first discovery of sudden stratospheric warmings in 1952. Time series of ERA5 global surface temperature anomalies show temperatures to be relatively stable from 1950 until the late 1970s, in agreement with the other contemporary full-input reanalysis covering this period and with independent data sets, although there are significant differences in the accuracy of representing specific regions, Europe being well represented in the early period but Australia less so. The variability of ERA5 precipitation from month to month agrees well with observations for all continents, with correlations above 90\% for most of Europe and generally in excess of 70\% for North America, Asia and Australia. The evolution of upper air temperatures, humidities and winds shows smoothly varying behaviour, including tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling, modulated by volcanic eruptions. The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation is well represented throughout. Aspects to be improved upon in future reanalyses include the assimilation of tropical cyclone data, the spin-up of soil moisture and stratospheric humidity, and the representation of surface temperatures over Australia.},

  abstract = {Data-driven modeling based on machine learning (ML) is showing enormous potential for weather forecasting. Rapid progress has been made with impressive results for some applications. The uptake of ML methods could be a game-changer for the incremental progress in traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) known as the “quiet revolution” of weather forecasting. The computational cost of running a forecast with standard NWP systems greatly hinders the improvements that can be made from increasing model resolution and ensemble sizes. An emerging new generation of ML models, developed using high-quality reanalysis datasets like ERA5 for training, allow forecasts that require much lower computational costs and that are highly-competitive in terms of accuracy. Here, we compare for the first time ML-generated forecasts with standard NWP-based forecasts in an operational-like context, initialized from the same initial conditions. Focusing on deterministic forecasts, we apply common forecast verification tools to assess to what extent a data-driven forecast produced with one of the recently developed ML models (PanguWeather) matches the quality and attributes of a forecast from one of the leading global NWP systems (the ECMWF IFS). The results are very promising, with comparable accuracy for both global metrics and extreme events, when verified against both the operational IFS analysis and synoptic observations. Overly smooth forecasts, increasing bias with forecast lead time, and poor performance in predicting tropical cyclone intensity are identified as current drawbacks of ML-based forecasts. A new NWP paradigm is emerging relying on inference from ML models and state-of-the-art analysis and reanalysis datasets for forecast initialization and model training.},

  abstract = {The area of surface reconstruction has seen substantial progress in the past two decades. The traditional problem addressed by surface reconstruction is to recover the digital representation of a physical shape that has been scanned, where the scanned data contains a wide variety of defects. While much of the earlier work has been focused on reconstructing a piece-wise smooth representation of the original shape, recent work has taken on more specialized priors to address significantly challenging data imperfections, where the reconstruction can take on different representations – not necessarily the explicit geometry. We survey the field of surface reconstruction, and provide a categorization with respect to priors, data imperfections, and reconstruction output. By considering a holistic view of surface reconstruction, we show a detailed characterization of the field, highlight similarities between diverse reconstruction techniques, and provide directions for future work in surface reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Understanding model error in state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models and representing its impact on flow-dependent predictability remains a complex and mostly unsolved problem. Here, a spectral stochastic kinetic energy backscatter scheme is used to simulate upscale-propagating errors caused by unresolved subgrid-scale processes. For this purpose, stochastic streamfunction perturbations are generated by autoregressive processes in spectral space and injected into regions where numerical integration schemes and parameterizations in the model lead to excessive systematic kinetic energy loss. It is demonstrated how output from coarse-grained high-resolution models can be used to inform the parameters of such a scheme. The performance of the spectral backscatter scheme is evaluated in the ensemble prediction system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Its implementation in conjunction with reduced initial perturbations results in a better spread–error relationship, more realistic kinetic-energy spectra, a better representation of forecast-error growth, improved flow-dependent predictability, improved rainfall forecasts, and better probabilistic skill. The improvement is most pronounced in the tropics and for largeanomaly events.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The last decade has seen the success of stochastic parameterizations in short-term, medium-range, and seasonal forecasts: operational weather centers now routinely use stochastic parameterization schemes to represent model inadequacy better and to improve the quantification of forecast uncertainty. Developed initially for numerical weather prediction, the inclusion of stochastic parameterizations not only provides better estimates of uncertainty, but it is also extremely promising for reducing long-standing climate biases and is relevant for determining the climate response to external forcing. This article highlights recent developments from different research groups that show that the stochastic representation of unresolved processes in the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and cryosphere of comprehensive weather and climate models 1) gives rise to more reliable probabilistic forecasts of weather and climate and 2) reduces systematic model bias. We make a case that the use of mathematically stringent methods for the derivation of stochastic dynamic equations will lead to substantial improvements in our ability to accurately simulate weather and climate at all scales. Recent work in mathematics, statistical mechanics, and turbulence is reviewed; its relevance for the climate problem is demonstrated; and future research directions are outlined.},

In the limit of large data, this approach converges to a Galerkin projection of the semigroup solution to the underlying dynamics on a basis adapted to the invariant measure. This approach allows one to quantify uncertainties (in fact, evolve the probability distribution) for nontrivial dynamical systems with equation-free modeling. We verify our approach on various examples, ranging from an inhomogeneous anisotropic stochastic differential equation on a torus, the chaotic Lorenz three-dimensional model, and the Ni ̃ no-3.4 data set which is used as a proxy of the El Ni ̃ no Southern Oscillation.},

In particular, the required sample is much larger than that needed for analyses of univariate extremes. We demonstrate that Single Model Initial-condition Large Ensemble (SMILE) simulations from multiple climate models, which provide hundreds to thousands of years of weather conditions, are crucial for advancing our assessments of compound events and constructing robust model projections. Combining SMILEs with an improved physical understanding of compound events will ultimately provide practitioners and stakeholders with the best available information on climate risks.},

At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial differential equations that describe the transition between those states               1               . However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods               2               have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39\,years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world’s best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)               3               . Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts.

  abstract = {Abstract. Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) are strongly ascending, cloud- and precipitation-forming airstreams in extratropical cyclones. The intense cloud-diabatic processes produce low-level cyclonic potential vorticity (PV) along the ascending airstreams, which often contribute to the intensification of the associated cyclone. This study investigates how climate change affects the cyclones' WCB strength and the importance of WCB-related diabatic PV production for cyclone intensification, based on present-day (1990–1999) and future (2091–2100) climate simulations of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE). In each period, a large number of cyclones and their associated WCB trajectories have been identified in both hemispheres during the winter season. WCB trajectories are identified as strongly ascending air parcels that rise at least 600\,hPa in 48\,h. Compared to ERA-Interim reanalyses, the present-day climate simulations are able to capture the cyclone structure and the associated WCBs reasonably well, which gives confidence in future projections with CESM-LE. However, the amplitude of the diabatically produced low-level PV anomaly in the cyclone centre is underestimated in the climate simulations, most likely because of reduced vertical resolution compared to ERA-Interim. The comparison of the simulations for the two climates reveals an increase in the WCB strength and the cyclone intensification rate in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in the future climate. The WCB strength also increases in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) but to a smaller degree, and the cyclone intensification rate is not projected to change considerably. Hence, in the two hemispheres cyclone intensification responds differently to an increase in WCB strength. Cyclone deepening correlates positively with the intensity of the associated WCB, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.68 (0.66) in the NH in the present-day (future) simulations and a coefficient of 0.51 (0.55) in the SH. The number of explosive cyclones with strong WCBs, referred to as C1 cyclones, is projected to increase in both hemispheres, while the number of explosive cyclones with weak WCBs (C3 cyclones) is projected to decrease. A composite analysis reveals that in the future climate C1 cyclones will be associated with even stronger WCBs, more WCB-related diabatic PV production, the formation of a more intense PV tower, and an increase in precipitation. They will become warmer, moister, and slightly more intense. The findings indicate that (i)~latent heating associated with WCBs (as identified with our method) will increase, (ii)~WCB-related PV production will be even more important for explosive cyclone intensification than in the present-day climate, and (iii)~the interplay between dry and moist dynamics is crucial to understand how climate change affects cyclone intensification.},

These algorithms rely on singular value decompositions associated to Ulam type discretisations of transfer operators induced by dynamical systems, and build on recent developments in multiplicative ergodic theory. Furthermore, they allow us to investigate various connections between the evolution of relevant singular value decompositions and dynamical features of the system.

Specific theoretical predictions of spectra, structure functions, probability distributions, and mechanisms are presented, and major experimental and numerical comparisons are reviewed. The introduction of 3D perturbations does not destroy the main features of the cascade picture, implying that 2D turbulence phenomenology establishes the general picture of turbulent fluid flows when one spatial direction is heavily constrained by geometry or by applied body forces. Such flows are common in geophysical and planetary contexts, are beautiful to observe, and reflect the impact of dimensionality on fluid turbulence.},

To answer this problem, an ‘objective filtering’ technique of the sample ensemble variances proposed by Raynaud               et al.               in 2009 has been implemented at ECMWF. In this article we present a comparison of the ability of ensemble data assimilation systems of different sizes (10 to 50 members) to represent flow‐dependent background‐error variances. In particular, the ensemble‐based variances are examined in the cases of the severe storm               Klaus               (24 January 2009) over France and the Atlantic tropical hurricane               Ike               (1–14 September 2008). Our results show that, while a relatively small ensemble (10 members) can be sufficient to resolve the larger‐scale error structures connected to an extratropical cyclogenesis, a larger ensemble is beneficial to resolve more localised anomalies like those connected with a hurricane. In this sense, the objective filtering technique provides a useful indication of the spatial scales the ensemble is able to resolve in a statistically robust way.                          The day‐to‐day variability of the ensemble statistics and how this affects the objective spatial filtering procedure are also examined. Our conclusion is that a time‐independent implementation of the filter based on a climatology of truncation wave numbers results in more robust ensemble statistics estimates, and ultimately in improved forecast skill scores.

  abstract = {The trend towards using flow‐dependent, ensemble‐based estimates of background‐error covariances has been one of the main themes of atmospheric data assimilation research and development in recent years. In this work it is documented how flow‐dependent ensemble information from the ECMWF ensemble of data assimilations (EDA) has gradually been incorporated into the               B               model which describes the background‐error covariance matrix at the start of the ECMWF 4D‐Var assimilation window. Starting with background‐error variances for the balanced part of the control vector and observation quality control, the current article extends the flow‐dependency to background‐error variances for the unbalanced part of the control vector and for background‐error correlation structures. The correlations are determined either online from previous days or from a hybrid of climatological and current cycle estimates. Each of these changes is shown to improve both the realism of the modelled               B               and the accuracy of the analysis and forecast fields produced by the 4D‐Var assimilation cycle which makes use of the improved               B               . Finally, increasing the resolution at which the EDA 4D‐Vars are run is shown to reduce the underestimation of the EDA‐based error estimates.},

A recent development in this area has been the emergence of fully data‐driven ML prediction models which routinely claim superior performance to that of traditional physics‐based models. We examine some aspects of the forecasts produced by three of the leading current ML models, Pangu‐Weather, FourCastNet and GraphCast, with a focus on their fidelity and physical consistency. The main conclusion is that these ML models are not able to properly reproduce sub‐synoptic and mesoscale weather phenomena and lack the fidelity and physical consistency of physics‐based models and this has impacts on the interpretation of their forecasts and their perceived skill.

Since assumptions imply some kind of scientific model, I believe that it is necessary to look at the process of scientific modelling itself to understand the nature of and the need for robust procedures. Against such a view it might be urged that some useful robust procedures have been derived empirically without an explicitly stated model. However, an empirical procedure implies some unstated model and there is often great virtue in bringing into the open the kind of assumptions that lead to useful methods. The need for robust methods seems to be intimately mixed up with the need for simple models. This we now discuss.},

  abstract = {Potential for regional climate engineering is gaining interest as a means of solving regional environmental problems like water scarcity and high temperatures. In the hyper-arid United Arab Emirates (UAE), water scarcity is reaching a crisis point due to high consumption and over-extraction and is being exacerbated by climate change. To counteract this problem, the UAE has conducted cloud-seeding operations and intensive desalination for many years but is now considering other means of increasing water resources. Very large “artificial black surfaces” (ABSs), made of black mesh, black-painted, or solar photovoltaic (PV) panels have been proposed as a means of enhancing convective precipitation via surface heating and amplification of vertical motion. Under the influence of the daily UAE sea breeze, this can lead to convection initiation under the right conditions. Currently it is not known how strong this rainfall enhancement would be or what scale of black surface would need to be employed. This study simulates the impacts at different ABS scales using the WRF-Noah-MP model chain and investigates impacts on precipitation quantities and underlying convective processes. Simulations of five square ABSs of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 km sizes were made on four 1 d cases, each for a period of 24 h. These were compared with a Control model run, with no land use change, to quantify impacts. The ABSs themselves were simulated by altering land cover static data and prescribing a unique set of land surface parameters like albedo and roughness length.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The jet stream over the Atlantic–European sector is relevant for weather and climate in Europe. It generates temperature extremes and steers moisture and flood-propelling weather systems to Europe or facilitates the development of atmospheric blocks, which can lead to drought. Ongoing climate change may alter the jet characteristics, affecting weather extremes. However, little is known about the past interannual-to-decadal variability of the jet stream. Here we analyse the strength, tilt and latitude of the Atlantic–European jet from 1421 to 2023 in an ensemble of monthly and daily reconstructions of atmospheric fields. We compare the variability of these jet indices with blocking frequency and cyclonic activity data and with drought and flood reconstructions in Europe. Summer drought is enhanced in Central Europe in periods with a poleward-shifted jet. An equatorward-shifted jet associated with decreased blocking leads to frequent floods in Western Europe and the Alps, particularly in winter. Recurrent weather patterns causing floods often characterize an entire season, such that an association between peak discharge and jet indices is seen on seasonal or even annual scales. Jet strength and tilt are significantly influenced by volcanic eruptions. Our 600-year perspective shows that recent changes in the jet indices are within the past variability and cannot be drivers of increasing flood and drought frequency.},

  abstract = {Weather regime forecasts are a prominent use case of sub-seasonal prediction in the midlatitudes. A systematic evaluation and understanding of year-round sub-seasonal regime forecast performance is still missing, however. Here we evaluate the representation of and forecast skill for seven year-round Atlantic–European weather regimes in sub-seasonal reforecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Forecast calibration improves regime frequency biases and forecast skill most strongly in summer, but scarcely in winter, due to considerable large-scale flow biases in summer. The average regime skill horizon in winter is about 5 days longer than in summer and spring, and 3 days longer than in autumn. The Zonal Regime and Greenland Blocking tend to have the longest year-round skill horizon, which is driven by their high persistence in winter. The year-round skill is lowest for the European Blocking, which is common for all seasons but most pronounced in winter and spring. For the related, more northern Scandinavian Blocking, the skill is similarly low in winter and spring but higher in summer and autumn. We further show that the winter average regime skill horizon tends to be enhanced following a strong stratospheric polar vortex (SPV), but reduced following a weak SPV. Likewise, the year-round average regime skill horizon tends to be enhanced following phases 4 and 7 of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) but reduced following phase 2, driven by winter but also autumn and spring. Our study thus reveals promising potential for year-round sub-seasonal regime predictions. Further model improvements can be achieved by reduction of the considerable large-scale flow biases in summer, better understanding and modeling of blocking in the European region, and better exploitation of the potential predictability provided by weak SPV states and specific MJO phases in winter and the transition seasons.},

  abstract = {Numerical weather prediction has seen, in the past 25 years, a shift from a ‘deterministic’ approach, based on single numerical integrations, to a probabilistic one, with ensembles of numerical integrations used to estimate the probability distribution function of forecast states. This shift to a probabilistic approach enabled a better extraction of predictive signals at longer lead times and provided a meaningful framework for extending the forecast length beyond 10 days. In this work, the limit of predictive skill is assessed for ECMWF monthly ensemble forecasts at different spatial and temporal scales. The forecast skill horizon is defined as the lead time when the ensemble ceases to be more skilful than a climatological distribution, using a continuous ranked probability score as metric. Results based on 32‐day ensemble forecasts indicate that the forecast skill horizon is sensitive to the spatial and temporal scale of the predicted phenomena, to the variable considered and the area analysed. On average over 1 year of forecasts, the forecast skill horizon for instantaneous, grid‐point fields is between 16 and 23 days, while it is considerably longer for time‐ and spatial‐average fields. Forecast skill horizons longer than the 2 weeks that were thought to be the limit are now achievable thanks to major advances in numerical weather prediction. More specifically, they are possible because forecasts are now framed in probabilistic terms, with a probability distribution estimated using ensembles generated using forecast models that include more components (e.g. a dynamical ocean and ocean waves) and more faithfully represent processes. Moreover, the forecasts start from more accurate initial conditions constructed using better data‐assimilation methods and more observational data.},

This work investigates the use of singular vectors, an ensemble of analyses, and a combination of the two types of perturbations in the ECMWF operational ensemble prediction system. First, the similarity between perturbations generated using initial‐time singular vectors (SVs) and analyses from the ensemble data assimilation (EDA) system is assessed. Results show that the EDA perturbations are less localized geographically and have a better coverage of the Tropics. EDA perturbations have also smaller scales than SV‐based perturbations, and have a less evident upshear vertical tilt, which explains why they grow less with forecast time. Then, the use of EDA‐based perturbations in the ECMWF ensemble prediction system is studied. Results indicate that if used alone, EDA‐based perturbations lead to an under‐dispersive and less skilful ensemble then the one based on initial‐time SVs only. Combining the EDA and the initial‐time SVs gives a system with a better agreement between ensemble spread and the error of the ensemble mean, a smaller ensemble‐mean error and more skilful probabilistic forecasts than the current operational system based on initial‐time and evolved SVs.

  abstract = {Originating in the equatorial Pacific, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has highly consequential global impacts, motivating the need to understand its responses to anthropogenic warming. In this Review, we synthesize advances in observed and projected changes of multiple aspects of ENSO, including the processes behind such changes. As in previous syntheses, there is an inter-model consensus of an increase in future ENSO rainfall variability. Now, however, it is apparent that models that best capture key ENSO dynamics also tend to project an increase in future ENSO sea surface temperature variability and, thereby, ENSO magnitude under greenhouse warming, as well as an eastward shift and intensification of ENSO-related atmospheric teleconnections — the Pacific–North American and Pacific–South American patterns. Such projected changes are consistent with palaeoclimate evidence of stronger ENSO variability since the 1950s compared with past centuries. The increase in ENSO variability, though underpinned by increased equatorial Pacific upper-ocean stratification, is strongly influenced by internal variability, raising issues about its quantifiability and detectability. Yet, ongoing coordinated community efforts and computational advances are enabling long-simulation, large-ensemble experiments and high-resolution modelling, offering encouraging prospects for alleviating model biases, incorporating fundamental dynamical processes and reducing uncertainties in projections.},

These phenomena have various implications for the ecosystem of the entire basin, affecting the atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere. Moreover, they cause numerous hazards to human society, especially concerning the environment and health, and are particularly significant to people living in a “Dust Belt” around Sahara, including nearby areas such as the Mediterranean 5 Basin. This study demonstrates that continuous dust intrusions from the Sahara, transported across distant geographic regions, cannot be considered random events; rather, they show long-range correlations for timescales shorter than 80 days. This behaviour generates a persistent and recurrent atmospheric pattern at inter-annual time scales and synoptic spatial scales, thus opening a new perspective for climate studies and evidencing a new kind of teleconnection between North Africa and the Mediterranean Basin.},

Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) and fronts are known to be related to the uplift and hence the precipitation within cyclones. The authors have investigated the link between WCBs and fronts and how such a link impacts the occurrence of extreme precipitation events. WCB trajectories have been calculated from the ERA-Interim dataset, and low-level (below 790 hPa) and midlevel (790–600 hPa) WCBs have been considered. These have been matched with objectively identified fronts (i.e., characterized by an overlap of WCB and front somewhere along the front). About 10\% of cold fronts, 8\% of warm fronts (identified using a thermal criterion), and 15\% of wind fronts (identified using a wind shift method) are matched with WCBs, while up to 70\% of WCBs are matched with fronts. Some WCBs, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, are not matched with either type of front (up to 70\% east of Australia). The relationship between WCBs and fronts does not change much between the low levels and midlevels, indicating that the WCBs are already strongly associated with fronts during the lowest part of their ascent, although in the Southern Hemisphere the WCBs are more often related to warm fronts during their midtropospheric ascent. In parts of the midlatitudes, more than 60\% of extreme precipitation events match either cold or warm fronts, and up to 90\% of these have matched WCBs. Fronts associated with WCBs are found to be between 2 and 10 times more likely to produce extreme precipitation events than fronts without associated WCBs.},

Utilizing data from four geopolitical regions across 24 countries, we explore whether vulnerability to natural disasters, brought on by either experiencing or anticipating a natural disaster, is a crucial factor. We find that as vulnerability to natural disasters increases, sustainable consumption intentions significantly increase among rightists in Western Europe, Israel, and the United States. Environmental motives, rather than economic or trend motives, are found to drive this effect. This suggests that, for rightists, the expectation of being directly impacted by climate change can override their established attitudes and foster more sustainable behavior with the goal of helping the environment. In contrast, the same increase in sustainable consumption intentions is weaker among leftists, who already embrace sustainable behavior. Interestingly, in Central and Eastern Europe, this interplay between political ideology and vulnerability to natural disasters is absent, highlighting the unique postcommunist context of this region. These findings underscore the necessity of tailored strategies for promoting sustainable behavior across regional contexts and provide vital insight into how sustainable consumption may increase among groups that have traditionally resisted it. In a quasiexperiment, we test the potential of an intervention using messages that highlight recent natural disasters in one’s locality and demonstrate its effectiveness in pushing rightists toward sustainable consumption.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This study compares the impacts of two stochastic parameterization schemes in a convective-scale model. The implementation of the physically based stochastic perturbation (PSP) scheme in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model represents uncertainties arising from unresolved boundary layer processes due to the finite grid size. Uncertainty in the microphysical processes is represented by the stochastic parameter perturbation applied to the microphysics parameterization (SPPMP) scheme. We examine the regime dependence of the impacts with 48-h forecasts of days with weakly and strongly forced convection, as well as winter storms. Early in the forecasts, the two stochastic parameterizations have different effects. The PSP scheme responds to boundary layer turbulence and produces strong perturbations that grow in phase with the diurnal cycle of convection. In regions with existing precipitation, SPPMP produces perturbations that grow more slowly with lead time, independent of the time of day. Perturbation growth in the PSP experiments is stronger for convective weather and can increase the total precipitation by triggering new convection, but SPPMP can dominate when precipitation occurs under stable conditions at night or in winter storms. The differences between the two schemes are relatively short-lived, and within a day of simulation, the amplitude and structure of differences introduced by both schemes are similar. This is found to be associated with saturation of perturbation growth on small scales (up to about 50 km). The locations and amplitudes of upscale perturbation growth appear to be determined by the larger-scale dynamics, independent of the details of the stochastic physics.                            Significance Statement               This study investigates how a physically based stochastic perturbation (PSP) scheme and a stochastic parameter perturbation to the microphysics parameterization (SPPMP) scheme impact forecast perturbation growth under different weather situations. The findings suggest that while the two stochastic parameterizations yield different impacts in the short term, they demonstrate overlapping effects in longer lead times despite their distinct theoretical foundations. This is due to the fact that once introduced, perturbations naturally grow in regions where the atmospheric flow exhibits moist instabilities. Consequently, sampling the two sources of uncertainty does not result in a proportional spread. This finding elucidates the notable success of ad hoc stochastic perturbation methods since forecast perturbation growth is primarily dominated by the underlying flow rather than the details of the stochastic schemes. The insights gained from this study are valuable for the community, particularly in the realm of developing ensemble systems. Moving forward, it is crucial to evaluate their impact within comprehensive ensemble systems that account for both initial and boundary condition uncertainties.},

Furthermore, compared to a constant volcanic forcing, employing a stochastic volcanic forcing reduces the probability of exceeding 1.5\,°C warming above pre-industrial level by at least 5\% for high climate mitigation scenario, and enhances the probability of negative decadal temperature trends by up to 8\%. Intermediate to high climate mitigation scenarios are particularly sensitive to the choice of future volcanic forcing implementation. We recommend the use of either a stochastic approach or prescribed constant forcing levels that sample volcanic uncertainty in future climate simulations.},

  abstract = {Numerical computer models play a key role in Earth science. They are used to make predictions on timescales ranging from short-range weather forecasts to multi-century climate projections. Computer models are also used as tools to understand the past, present, and future climate system, enabling numerical experiments to be carried out to explore physical processes of interest. To understand the behavior of these models, their formulation must be appreciated, including the simplifications and approximations employed in developing the model code.             Foremost among these approximations are the parametrization schemes used to represent subgrid scale physical processes. A useful mathematical formulation of parametrization often involves Reynolds averaging, whereby a flow described by the Navier–Stokes equations is separated into a slow, resolved component and a fast, unresolved component. On performing this decomposition, the component representing the unresolved, fast processes is shown to impact the resolved scale flow: It is this component that a parametrization seeks to represent.             Parametrization schemes encode the understanding of the salient physics needed to describe processes in the atmosphere and ocean and other components of the Earth system, such as land and ice. For example, finding the relationship between the Reynolds stresses and the mean fields of the system is the turbulence closure problem, which is common to both atmospheric and oceanic numerical models. Atmospheric parametrization schemes include those representing radiation, clouds and cloud microphysics, moist convection, gravity waves, and the boundary layer (which encompasses a representation of turbulent mixing). In the ocean, eddy processes must also be parametrized, including stirring and mixing due to both sub-mesoscale and mesoscale eddies. The similarities between the parametrization problem in atmospheric and oceanic models facilitate transfer of knowledge between these two communities, such that promising avenues of research in one community can in principle readily be adapted and adopted by the other.},

  abstract = {El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of interannual variability in the tropical Pacific. However, the models in the ensemble from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) have large deficiencies in ENSO amplitude, spatial structure, and temporal variability. The use of stochastic parameterizations as a technique to address these pervasive errors is considered. The multiplicative stochastically perturbed parameterization tendencies (SPPT) scheme is included in coupled integrations of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 (CAM4). The SPPT scheme results in a significant improvement to the representation of ENSO in CAM4, improving the power spectrum and reducing the magnitude of ENSO toward that observed. To understand the observed impact, additive and multiplicative noise in a simple delayed oscillator (DO) model of ENSO is considered. Additive noise results in an increase in ENSO amplitude, but multiplicative noise can reduce the magnitude of ENSO, as was observed for SPPT in CAM4. In light of these results, two complementary mechanisms are proposed by which the improvement occurs in CAM. Comparison of the coupled runs with a set of atmosphere-only runs indicates that SPPT first improve the variability in the zonal winds through perturbing the convective heating tendencies, which improves the variability of ENSO. In addition, SPPT improve the distribution of westerly wind bursts (WWBs), important for initiation of El Niño events, by increasing the stochastic component of WWB and reducing the overly strong dependency on SST compared to the control integration.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Blocked weather regimes are an important phenomenon in the Euro-Atlantic region and are frequently linked to extreme weather events. Despite their importance for surface weather, the correct prediction of blocking events remains challenging. Previous studies indicated a link between the misrepresentation of blocking events in numerical weather prediction models and sea surface temperature (SST) biases, particularly in the Gulf Stream region. However, the pathway that links SST in the Gulf Stream region and the downstream upper-level flow is not yet fully understood. To deepen our physical understanding of the link between the Gulf Stream SST and downstream atmospheric blocking, we perform sensitivity experiments with varying SST conditions for an atmospheric blocking event in February 2019. This blocking event, which was associated with a winter heat wave with unprecedented temperatures in western Europe, was both preceded and accompanied by several rapidly intensifying extratropical cyclones originating in the Gulf Stream region and crossing the North Atlantic. Those cyclones and their associated rapidly ascending air streams, so-called warm conveyor belts (WCBs), played a crucial role in the development of the upper-level ridge and the blocking event. The ascent of these WCBs, which connect the lower and upper troposphere, was enhanced by moisture uptake during cold air outbreaks (CAOs) in the Gulf Stream region. In this study, we employ sensitivity experiments with the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate Model (ICON) to assess the impact of intense air–sea interactions during CAOs on WCBs and the downstream ridge. In total five different experiments are used, including idealized and weakened SST gradients and one with increased absolute SST in the Gulf Stream region. Using Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives, we demonstrate that the SST gradient in the Gulf Stream region affects moisture availability and air temperature in the WCB inflow region and, consequently, WCB ascent. In our case study, stronger SST gradients lead to increased specific humidity and warmer temperatures in the lower troposphere, resulting in more pronounced WCB ascent, while weaker SST gradients are associated with reduced WCB activity. The differences in WCB ascent and outflow properties induced by weakened SST gradients, such as reduced cross-isentropic ascent and outflow heights, subsequently influence the upper-level flow and weaken the downstream ridge. Moreover, experiments with weaker SST gradients show a decrease in cyclone intensity, and vice versa, stronger cyclones are found in experiments with warmer SSTs. To summarize, our results suggest that different SST and SST gradient representations affect the large-scale atmospheric flow via the WCB airstream. Specifically, moisture availability regulated by SST and SST gradients in the WCB inflow region influences subsequent WCB ascent and outflow characteristics, which, in turn, influence the upper-level ridge downstream. The SST in the Gulf Stream region affects WCB characteristics consistently from the inflow, over the ascent to the outflow phase.},

Preconditioning is considered and, although it offers a significant reduction in cost, it seems that it is unlikely to provide a reduction as large as an order of magnitude. An approximation to 4D-Var, namely the incremental approach, is then considered and is shown to produce the same result at the end of the assimilation window as an extended Kalman filter in which no approximations are made in the assimilating model but in which instead a simplified evolution of the forecast error is introduced. This approach provides the flexibility for a cost—benefit trade-off of 4D-Var to be made.},

  abstract = {The errors in numerical weather forecasts resulting from limited ensemble size are explored using 1,000-member forecasts of convective weather over Germany at 3-km resolution. A large number of forecast variables at different lead times were examined, and their distributions could be classified into three categories: quasi-normal (e.g., tropospheric temperature), highly skewed (e.g. precipitation), and mixtures (e.g., humidity). Dependence on ensemble size was examined in comparison to the asymptotic convergence law that the sampling error decreases proportional to N−1/2 for large enough ensemble size N, independent of the underlying distribution shape. The asymptotic convergence behavior was observed for the ensemble mean of all forecast variables, even for ensemble sizes less than 10. For the ensemble standard deviation, sizes of up to 100 were required for the convergence law to apply. In contrast, there was no clear sign of convergence for the 95th percentile even with 1,000 members. Methods such as neighborhood statistics or prediction of area-averaged quantities were found to improve accuracy, but only for variables with random small-scale variability, such as convective precipitation.},

Climatological analysis indicates that the dominant pattern of climate variability in the Euro–Atlantic sector during this winter was not a negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), but a pattern with a “blocklike” center located immediately upstream of the continent. Synoptic-dynamical diagnosis of the winter indicates the frequent occurrence of long-lasting blocks in this region, and a Lagrangian trajectory analysis points to the significant role of cloud-diabatic effects in the dynamics of block inception. A series of heuristic numerical simulations lend credence to the hypothesis that the occurrence of the blocks was sensitive to, and significantly influenced by, the warm surface temperature anomalies upstream over the western Atlantic Ocean and North America.

  abstract = {A dynamically based climatology is derived for Northern Hemisphere atmospheric blocking events. Blocks are viewed as large amplitude, long-lasting, and negative potential vorticity (PV) anomalies located beneath the dynamical tropopause. The derived climatology [based on the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40)] provides a concise, coherent, and illuminating description of the main physical characteristics of blocks and the accompanying linear trends. The latitude–longitude distribution of blocking frequency captures the standard bimodal geographical distribution with major peaks over the North Atlantic and eastern North Pacific in all four seasons. The accompanying pattern for the age distribution, the genesis–lysis regions, and the track of blocks reveals that 1) younger blocks (1–4 days) are more prevalent at lower latitudes whereas significantly older blocks (up to 12 days) are located at higher latitudes; 2) genesis is confined predominantly to the two major ocean basins and in a zonal band between 40° and 50°N latitude, whereas lysis is more dispersed but with clear preference to higher latitudes; and 3) the general northeastward–west-northwest movement of blocks in the genesis–lysis phase also exhibits subtle seasonal and intra- and interbasin differences. Examination of the intensity and spatial-scale changes during the blocking life cycle suggests that in the mean a block’s evolution is independent of the genesis region and its eventual duration. A novel analysis of blocking trends reveals significant negative trends in winter over Greenland and in spring over the North Pacific. It is shown that the changes over Greenland are linked to the number of blocking episodes, whereas a neighboring trend signal to the south is linked to higher-frequency anticyclonic systems. Furthermore, evidence is adduced that changes in blocking frequency contribute seminally to tropopause height trends.},

A low-order barotropic model with topography is studied, in which topographic and barotropic instabilities are the mechanisms dominating the dynamics. By parameter tuning, the Hopf bifurcation corresponding to barotropic instability can be made to coincide with one of the saddle-node bifurcations that are due to the topography in the model. This coincidence is called a fold-Hopf bifurcation. Among the dynamical structures related to such a bifurcation are heteroclinic connections and homoclinic orbits, connected to the equilibria. A heteroclinic cycle back and forth between the equilibria, existing in the truncated normal form of the fold-Hopf bifuraction, will be perturbed in the full model, leaving orbits homoclinic to one of the equilibria. The impact of these mathematical structures explains several characteristics of regime behavior known from previous model studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The simulation and prediction of winter Northern Hemisphere atmospheric blocking in the seasonal prediction systems from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is analysed. Blocking statistics from the operational November‐initialised seasonal hindcasts are evaluated in three generations of models: System3, System4, and System5 (SEAS5). Improvements in the climatological representation of blocking are observed in the most recent model configurations, with reduced bias over North Pacific and Greenland. Minor progress is seen over the European sector, where SEAS5 still underestimates the observed blocking frequency. SEAS5 blocking interannual variability is underestimated too and is proportional to the climatological frequency, highlighting that a negative bias in the blocking frequency implies an underestimation of the interannual variance. SEAS5 predictive skill and signal‐to‐noise ratio remain low, but interesting positive results are found over Western and Central Europe. Improved forecasts with reduced ensemble spread are obtained during El Niño years, especially at low latitudes. Complementary experiments show that the statistics of blocking are improved following atmospheric and oceanic resolution increase. Conversely, they remain largely insensitive to coupled model sea‐surface temperature (SST) errors. On the other hand, the implementation of stochastic parameterisations tends to displace blocking activity equatorward. Finally, by comparing seasonal hindcasts with climate runs using the same model, we highlight that the largest contributors to the chronic underestimation of blocking are persistent errors in the atmospheric model. It is also shown that SST errors have a larger impact on blocking bias in climate runs than in seasonal runs, and that increased ocean model resolution contributes to improved blocking more effectively in climate runs. Seasonal forecasts can thus be considered a suitable test‐bed for model development targeting blocking improvement in climate models.},

A higher resolution configuration of the same model, with horizontal resolution typical of that used in operational numerical weather prediction, is able to simulate these regime structures realistically. The spatial patterns of the simulated regimes are remarkably accurate at high resolution. A model configuration at intermediate resolution shows a marked improvement over the low-resolution configuration, particularly in terms of the temporal characteristics of the regimes, but does not produce a simulation as accurate as the very-high-resolution configuration. It is demonstrated that the simulation of regimes can be significantly improved, even at low resolution, by the introduction of a stochastic physics scheme. At low resolution the stochastic physics scheme drastically improves both the spatial and temporal aspects of the regimes simulation. These results highlight the importance of small-scale processes on large-scale climate variability, and indicate that although simulating variability at small scales is a necessity, it may not be necessary to represent the small-scales accurately, or even explicitly, in order to improve the simulation of largescale climate. It is argued that these results could have important implications for improving both global climate simulations, and the ability of high-resolution limited-area models, forced by low-resolution global models, to reliably simulate regional climate change signals.},

In this study, we use several numerical experimentation approaches with a state-of-the-art global operational numerical weather prediction system to investigate this idea further. Focusing on boreal winter, we investigate whether the influence of the Arctic on midlatitude weather, and the impact of the current Arctic observing system on the skill of medium-range weather forecasts in the midlatitudes is more pronounced in certain flow regimes. Using so-called Observing System Experiments, we demonstrate that removing in situ or satellite observations from the data assimilation system, used to create the initial conditions for the forecasts, deteriorates midlatitude synoptic forecast skill in the medium-range, particularly over northern Asia. This deterioration is largest during Scandinavian Blocking episodes, during which: (a) error growth is enhanced in the European-Arctic, as a result of increased baroclinicity in the region, and (b) high-amplitude planetary waves allow errors to propagate from the Arctic into midlatitudes. The important role played by Scandinavian Blocking, in modulating the influence of the Arctic on midlatitudes, is also corroborated in relaxation experiments, and through a diagnostic analysis of the ERA5 reanalysis and reforecasts.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Stochastic parametrisation techniques have been used by operational weather centres for decades to produce ensemble forecasts and to represent uncertainties in the forecast model. Their use has been demonstrated to be highly beneficial, as it increases the reliability of the forecasting system and reduces systematic biases. Despite the random nature of the perturbation techniques, the response of the model can be nonlinear, and the mean state of the model can change. In this study, we attempt to provide a process-based understanding of how stochastic model perturbations affect the model climate. Previous work has revealed sensitivities of the occurrence of diabatically driven, rapidly ascending airstreams to the stochastically perturbed parametrisation tendencies (SPPT) scheme. Such strongly ascending airstreams are linked to different weather phenomena, such as precipitation and upper-tropospheric ridge building in the midlatitudes, which raises the question of whether these processes are also influenced by stochastic perturbations. First, we analyse if rapidly ascending airstreams also show sensitivities to a different perturbation technique – the stochastically perturbed parametrisations (SPP) scheme, which directly represents parameter uncertainty in parametrisations and has recently been developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). By running a set of sensitivity experiments with the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) and by employing a Lagrangian detection of ascending airstreams, we show that SPP results in a systematic increase in the occurrence of ascending air parcel trajectories compared to simulations with unperturbed model physics. This behaviour is very similar to that of SPPT, although some regional differences are apparent. The one-sided response to the stochastic forcing is also observed when only specific parametrisations are perturbed (only convection parametrisation and all parametrisations but convection), and we hypothesise that the effect cannot be attributed to a single process. Thereafter, we link the frequency changes in ascending airstreams to closely related weather phenomena. While the signal of increased ascending motion is directly transmitted to global precipitation sums for all analysed schemes, changes to the amplitude of the upper-level Rossby wave pattern are more subtle. In agreement with the trajectory analysis, both SPPT and SPP increase the waviness of the upper-level flow and thereby reduce a systematic bias in the model, even though the magnitude is small. Our study presents a coherent process chain that enables us to understand how stochastic perturbations systematically affect the model climate. We argue that weather systems which are characterised by threshold behaviour on the one hand and that serve as a dynamical hinge between spatial scales on the other hand can convert zero-mean perturbations into an asymmetric response and project it onto larger scales.},

Current global circulation models struggle to fully capture observed blocking frequencies, likely because of their coarse horizontal resolution. Here we use convection permitting, nested idealized model simulations for quantifying changes in blocking frequency and Rossby wave breaking compared to a coarser resolution reference. We find an increase in blocking frequency poleward and downstream of the area with increased resolution, while the exact regions depend on the blocking index. These changes are probably due to a more accurate representation of small‐scale processes such as diabatic heating, which affect Rossby wave breaking and blocking formation downstream. Our results thus suggest an improved representation of blocking in the next generation of high‐resolution global climate models.},

This study strived to draw together key prominent dynamical mechanisms governing seasonal temperature variability in a warming climate, which can serve as a recognizable flow pattern and yield insights into their most important triggering mechanisms and maintenance. The connection between cold spells and atmospheric blocking was elucidated by utilizing an objective cold‐wave indicator and a two‐dimensional blocking indicator. The cold‐wave indicator ‐which uses a non‐parametric approach to diagnose a spatiotemporally varying minimum temperature threshold‐ gave an objective account of cold spells of January 2017. An analysis of cold‐wave activities indicated that parts of Europe and Turkey went through very cold weather conditions for approximately 7–12\,days. Cold spells were closely related to the position of the blocking and the 500\,hPa geopotential height anomalies. The horizontal distribution of surface temperature anomalies indicated that associated temperature anomalies were quite large in the south‐eastern Europe and Turkey. The persistence of the anticyclone over the eastern Atlantic steered the low pressure system towards the south‐eastern Europe and Turkey. The collocation of prominent atmospheric patterns led to the formation of extreme cold spells. Our results of two‐dimensional atmospheric blocking index revealed that blocking lasted for 5\,days over the eastern Atlantic ‐which enabled anticyclonic conditions persisting. Diagnostics indicate that the imposed blocking over the north‐east Atlantic alters the direction and strength of the zonal flow in the south‐eastern Europe, which influences the behaviour of synoptic‐scale flow in its downstream. These results are consistent with the inferences drawn from surface temperature analyses, which accentuate the role of blocking imposed circulation on the anomalous low temperature anomalies. Characteristics of blocking at the north‐eastern Atlantic shed light on the winter climate variability over Europe and Turkey.},

  abstract = {In a simple, one-layer atmospheric model, we study the links between low-frequency variability and the model’s fixed points in phase space. The model dynamics is characterized by the coexistence of multiple “weather regimes.” To investigate the transitions from one regime to another, we focus on the identification of stable manifolds associated with fixed points. We show that these manifolds act as separatrices between regimes. We track each manifold by making use of two local predictability measures arising from the meteorological applications of nonlinear dynamics, namely, “bred vectors” and singular vectors. These results are then verified in the framework of ensemble forecasts issued from “clouds” (ensembles) of initial states. The divergence of the trajectories allows us to establish the connections between zones of low predictability, the geometry of the stable manifolds, and transitions between regimes.},

Under this assumption, it is shown how simple consistency diagnostics can be obtained for the covariances of observation, background and estimation errors in observation space. Those diagnostics are shown to be nearly cost-free since they only combine quantities available after the analysis, i.e. observed values and their background and analysis counterparts in observation space. A first application of such diagnostics is presented on analyses provided by the French 4D-Var assimilation. A procedure to refine background and observation-error variances is also proposed and tested in a simple toy analysis problem. The possibility to diagnose cross-correlations between observation errors is also investigated in this same simple framework. A spectral interpretation of the diagnosed covariances is finally presented, which allows us to highlight the role of the scale separation between background and observation errors.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Stationary, long-lasting blocked weather patterns can lead to extreme conditions such as anomalously high temperatures or heavy rainfall. The exact locations of such extremes depend on the location of the vortices that form the block. There are two main types of blocking: (i)~a high-over-low block with a high located poleward of an isolated low and (ii) an omega block with two lows that lie southeast and southwest of the blocking high in the Northern Hemisphere. In this work, we refine a novel method based on the kinematic vorticity number and the point vortex theory that allows us to distinguish between these two blocking types. Based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–Department of Energy~(NCEP–DOE) Reanalysis~2 data, we study the trends of the occurrence probability and the onset (formation), decay (offset) and transition probabilities of high-over-low and omega blocking in the 30-year period from~1990 to~2019 in the Northern Hemisphere (90∘\,W–90∘\,E) and in the Euro-Atlantic sector (40∘\,W–30∘\,E). First, we use logistic regression to investigate long-term changes in blocking probabilities for full years, seasons and months. While trends are small for annual values, changes in occurrence probability are more visible and also more diverse when broken down to seasonal and monthly resolution, showing a prominent increase in February and March and a decrease in December. A three-state multinomial regression describing the occurrence of omega and high-over-low blocking reveals different trends for both types. Particularly the February and December changes are dominated by the omega blocking type. Additionally, we use Markov models to describe transition probabilities for a two-state (unblocked, blocked) and a three-state (unblocked, omega block, high-over-low block) Markov model. We find the largest changes in transition probabilities in the summer season, where the transition probabilities towards omega blocks significantly increase, while the unblocked state becomes less probable. Prominent in winter are decreasing probabilities for transitions from omega to high-over-low and persistence of the latter. Moreover, we show that omega blocking is more likely to occur and to be more persistent than the high-over-low blocking pattern.},

The potential for skillful seasonal forecasts of the winter NAO using an ensemble-based dynamical prediction system has only recently been demonstrated. Here we show that the winter predictability can be significantly improved by refining a dynamical ensemble through subsampling. We enhance prediction skill of surface temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure over essential parts of the Northern Hemisphere by retaining only the ensemble members whose NAO state is close to a “first guess” NAO prediction based on a statistical analysis of the initial autumn state of the ocean, sea ice, land, and stratosphere. The correlation coefficient between the reforecasted and observation-based winter NAO is significantly increased from 0.49 to 0.83 over a reforecast period from 1982 to 2016, and from 0.42 to 0.86 for a forecast period from 2001 to 2017. Our novel approach represents a successful and robust alternative to further increasing the ensemble size, and potentially can be used in operational seasonal prediction systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events can significantly impact tropospheric weather for a period of several weeks, in particular in the North Atlantic–European (NAE) region. While the stratospheric forcing often projects onto the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the tropospheric response to SSW events, if any, is highly variable, and what determines the existence, location, timing, and strength of the downward impact remains an open question. We here explore how the variable tropospheric response to SSW events in the NAE region can be characterized in terms of a refined set of seven weather regimes and if the tropospheric flow in the North Atlantic region around the onset of SSW events is an indicator of the subsequent downward impact. The weather regime analysis reveals the Greenland blocking (GL) and Atlantic trough (AT) regimes as the most frequent large-scale patterns in the weeks following an SSW. While the GL regime is dominated by high pressure over Greenland, AT is dominated by a southeastward-shifted storm track in the North Atlantic. The flow evolution associated with GL and the associated cold conditions over Europe in the weeks following an SSW occur most frequently if a blocking situation over western Europe and the North Sea (European blocking) prevailed around the SSW onset. In contrast, an AT regime associated with mild conditions over Europe is more likely following the SSW event if GL occurs already around SSW onset. For the remaining tropospheric flow regimes during SSW onset we cannot identify a dominant flow evolution. Although it remains unclear what causes these relationships, the results suggest that specific tropospheric states in the days around the onset of the SSW are an indicator of the subsequent tropospheric flow evolution in the aftermath of an SSW, which could provide crucial guidance for subseasonal prediction.},

  abstract = {Because weather and climate models must capture a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales, they rely heavily on parameterizations of subgrid-scale processes. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that the assumptions used to couple these parameterizations have an important effect on the climate of version 0 of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) General Circulation Model (GCM), a close relative of version 1 of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1). Like most GCMs, parameterizations in E3SM are sequentially split in the sense that parameterizations are called one after another with each subsequent process feeling the effect of the preceding processes. This coupling strategy is noncommutative in the sense that the order in which processes are called impacts the solution. By examining a suite of 24 simulations with deep convection, shallow convection, macrophysics/microphysics, and radiation parameterizations reordered, process order is shown to have a big impact on predicted climate. In particular, reordering of processes induces differences in net climate feedback that are as big as the intermodel spread in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. One reason why process ordering has such a large impact is that the effect of each process is influenced by the processes preceding it. Where output is written is therefore an important control on apparent model behavior. Application of k-means clustering demonstrates that the positioning of macro/microphysics and shallow convection plays a critical role on the model solution.},

This counter-intuitive effect has been observed in geophysical models of varying complexity, and here we investigate the mechanisms underlying stochastic regime dynamics in a conceptual model. We use a sixmode truncation of a barotropic β-plane model, featuring transitions between analogues of zonal and blocked flow conditions, and identify mechanisms similar to those seen previously in work on low-dimensional random maps. Namely, we show that a geometric mechanism, here relating to monotonic instability growth, allows for asymmetric action of symmetric perturbations on regime lifetime and that random scattering can “trap” the flow in more stable regions of phase space. We comment on the implications for understanding more complex atmospheric systems.},

  abstract = {Significance             There is a long-standing debate about whether climate models are able to simulate large, abrupt events that characterized past climates. Here, we document a large, spontaneously occurring cold event in a preindustrial control run of a new climate model. The event is comparable to the Little Ice Age both in amplitude and duration; it is abrupt in its onset and termination, and it is characterized by a long period in which the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic is locked into a state with enhanced blocking. To simulate this type of abrupt climate change, climate models should possess sufficient resolution to correctly represent atmospheric blocking and a sufficiently sensitive sea-ice model.           ,              Abrupt climate change is abundant in geological records, but climate models rarely have been able to simulate such events in response to realistic forcing. Here we report on a spontaneous abrupt cooling event, lasting for more than a century, with a temperature anomaly similar to that of the Little Ice Age. The event was simulated in the preindustrial control run of a high-resolution climate model, without imposing external perturbations. Initial cooling started with a period of enhanced atmospheric blocking over the eastern subpolar gyre. In response, a southward progression of the sea-ice margin occurred, and the sea-level pressure anomaly was locked to the sea-ice margin through thermal forcing. The cold-core high steered more cold air to the area, reinforcing the sea-ice concentration anomaly east of Greenland. The sea-ice surplus was carried southward by ocean currents around the tip of Greenland. South of 70°N, sea ice already started melting and the associated freshwater anomaly was carried to the Labrador Sea, shutting off deep convection. There, surface waters were exposed longer to atmospheric cooling and sea surface temperature dropped, causing an even larger thermally forced high above the Labrador Sea. In consequence, east of Greenland, anomalous winds changed from north to south, terminating the event with similar abruptness to its onset. Our results imply that only climate models that possess sufficient resolution to correctly represent atmospheric blocking, in combination with a sensitive sea-ice model, are able to simulate this kind of abrupt climate change.},

  abstract = {The spectral turbulence model of Lorenz, as modified for surface quasigeostrophic dynamics by Rotunno and Snyder, is further modified to more smoothly approach nonlinear saturation. This model is used to investigate error growth starting from different distributions of the initial error. Consistent with an often overlooked finding by Lorenz, the loss of predictability generated by initial errors of small but fixed absolute magnitude is essentially independent of their spatial scale when the background saturation kinetic energy spectrum is proportional to the 25/3 power of the wavenumber. Thus, because the background kinetic energy increases with scale, very small relative errors at long wavelengths have similar impacts on perturbation error growth as large relative errors at short wavelengths. To the extent that this model applies to practical meteorological forecasts, the influence of initial perturbations generated by butterflies would be swamped by unavoidable tiny relative errors in the large scales.},

  abstract = {In the past few decades, boreal summers have been characterized by an increasing number of extreme weather events in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, including persistent heat waves, droughts and heavy rainfall events with significant social, economic, and environmental impacts. Many of these events have been associated with the presence of anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, in particular, persistent blocking situations, i.e., nearly stationary spatial patterns of air pressure. To contribute to a better understanding of the emergence and dynamical properties of such situations, we construct complex networks representing the atmospheric circulation based on Lagrangian trajectory data of passive tracers advected within the atmospheric flow. For these Lagrangian flow networks, we study the spatial patterns of selected node properties prior to, during, and after different atmospheric blocking events in Northern Hemisphere summer. We highlight the specific network characteristics associated with the sequence of strong blocking episodes over Europe during summer 2010 as an illustrative example. Our results demonstrate the ability of the node degree, entropy, and harmonic closeness centrality based on outgoing links to trace important spatiotemporal characteristics of atmospheric blocking events. In particular, all three measures capture the effective separation of the stationary pressure cell forming the blocking high from the normal westerly flow and the deviation of the main atmospheric currents around it. Our results suggest the utility of further exploiting the Lagrangian flow network approach to atmospheric circulation in future targeted diagnostic and prognostic studies.},

Equivalently, isochrons can be characterized as stable manifolds foliating neighborhoods of the limit cycle or as level sets of an isochron map. In recent years, there has been a lively discussion in the mathematical physics community on how to define isochrons for stochastic oscillations, i.e. limit cycles or heteroclinic cycles exposed to stochastic noise. The main discussion has concerned an approach finding stochastic isochrons as sections of equal expected return times versus the idea of considering eigenfunctions of the backward Kolmogorov operator. We discuss the problem in the framework of random dynamical systems and introduce a new rigorous definition of stochastic isochrons as random stable manifolds for random periodic solutions with noise-dependent period. This allows us to establish a random version of isochron maps whose level sets coincide with the random stable manifolds. Finally, we discuss links between the random dynamical systems interpretation and the equal expected return time approach via averaged quantities.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS) was launched on the NOAA-15 satellite in May 1998. This provided a very significant improvement in the information available from meteorological polar-orbiting satellites compared with the previous TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder system, particularly for humidity and vertical resolution of temperature in cloudy areas. In preparation for assimilation of the observations into a three-dimensional analysis of atmospheric temperature and humidity, the observations have been compared with calculated top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures computed from numerical weather prediction model profiles of temperature and humidity. Differences between observed and modelled brightness temperature are small. In some parts of the tropics and northern hemisphere the standard deviation of these differences for the tropospheric Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit sounding channels is only marginally higher than the radiometric noise of the observations. Early in 1999 a series of observation-system experiments were completed in which ATOVS observations were assimilated using a one-dimensional variational analysis. No use of the new humidity information could be made because of interference problems experienced by the microwave humidity sounder on ATOVS. Nonetheless, these experiments showed that the assimilation of the new temperature information provided by the radiance observations reduces forecast errors by as much as 20\% in the southern hemisphere and 5\% in the northern hemisphere. Further improvements have been found by assimilating more data over land. The major impact arises from the microwave channels. Whilst forward-model errors may be slightly lower for the microwave channels than the infrared channels the primary reason is the provision of sounding information in active weather systems, which are usually cloudy.},

In response to this pressing issue, we present ClimaMeter, a platform designed to assess and contextualize extreme-weather events relative to climate change. The platform offers near-real-time insights into the dynamics of extreme events, serving as a resource for researchers and policymakers while also being a science dissemination tool for the general public. ClimaMeter currently analyses heatwaves, cold spells, heavy precipitation, and windstorms. This paper elucidates the methodology, data sources, and analytical techniques on which ClimaMeter relies, providing a comprehensive overview of its scientific foundation. We further present two case studies: the late 2023 French heatwave and the July 2023 Storm Poly. We use two distinct datasets for each case study, namely Multi-Source Weather (MSWX) data, which serve as the reference for our rapid-attribution protocol, and the ERA5 dataset, widely regarded as the leading global climate reanalysis. These examples highlight both the strengths and limitations of ClimaMeter in expounding the link between climate change and the dynamics of extreme-weather events.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Atmospheric flows are characterized by chaotic dynamics and recurring large-scale patterns. These two characteristics point to the existence of an atmospheric attractor defined by Lorenz as: “the collection of all states that the system can assume or approach again and again, as opposed to those that it will ultimately avoid”. The average dimension               D               of the attractor corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom sufficient to describe the atmospheric circulation. However, obtaining reliable estimates of               D               has proved challenging. Moreover,               D               does not provide information on transient atmospheric motions, such as those leading to weather extremes. Using recent developments in dynamical systems theory, we show that such motions can be classified through instantaneous rather than average properties of the attractor. The instantaneous properties are uniquely determined by instantaneous dimension and stability. Their extreme values correspond to specific atmospheric patterns, and match extreme weather occurrences. We further show the existence of a significant correlation between the time series of instantaneous stability and dimension and the mean spread of sea-level pressure fields in an operational ensemble weather forecast at lead times of over two weeks. Instantaneous properties of the attractor therefore provide an efficient way of evaluating and informing operational weather forecasts.},

Furthermore, there is little knowledge on how the difficulty of forecasting weather may be affected by anthropogenic climate change. Here, we address this question by employing metrics issued from dynamical systems theory to describe the atmospheric circulation and infer the dynamical properties of the climate system. Specifically, we evaluate the changes in the sub-seasonal predictability of the large-scale atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic for the historical period and under anthropogenic forcing, using centennial reanalyses and CMIP5 simulations. For the future period, most datasets point to an increase in the atmosphere’s predictability. AMIP simulations with 4               K               warmer oceans and 4~× atmospheric CO               2               concentrations highlight the prominent role of a warmer ocean in driving this increase.

Diffusion Maps (DM) is a recent technique that can capture the lower dimensional geometric structure underlying the sample patterns in a way which can be made to be independent of the sampling distribution. Moreover, DM allows us to define an embedding whose Euclidean metric relates to the sample's intrinsic one which, in turn, enables a principled application of k-means clustering. In this work we give a self-contained review of DM and discuss two methods to compute the DM embedding coordinates to new out-of-sample data. Then, we will apply them on two meteorological data problems that involve time and spatial compression of numerical weather forecasts and show how DM is capable to, first, greatly reduce the initial dimension while still capturing relevant information in the original data and, also, how the sample-derived DM embedding coordinates can be extended to new patterns.},

The focus is on the Euro‐Atlantic sector during the extended winter period when the atmospheric regime structure is most pronounced. Verification results show that, in the medium range, forecasts initiated in the negative phase of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO−) are the most skillful. For these forecasts the ensemble spread over Europe is lower than average, showing that the ensemble spread provides useful information about the error of the ensemble‐mean forecast. The performance of the ensemble is further assessed by stratifying the cases according to their initial conditions, as well as by their accuracy at forecast day 10. Results indicate that the least skillful predictions are mainly associated with missing the transitions to a blocking regime circulation. Forecasts also underestimate the blocking persistence, whereas they overestimate the persistence of zonal flows. Transitions to a positive phase of the NAO are also overrepresented.},

The study of these qualitative changes, called tipping phenomena, requires the development of new methodological approaches that allow phenomena observed in nature to be modeled, analyzed and predicted, especially concerning the climate crisis and its consequences. Here we briefly review the mechanisms of classical tipping phenomena and investigate rate-dependent tipping phenomena which occur in non-autonomous systems characterized by multiple timescales in more detail. We focus on the mechanism of rate-induced tipping caused by basin boundary crossings. We unravel the mechanism of this transition and analyze, in particular, the role of such basin boundary crossings in non-autonomous systems when a parameter drift induces a saddle-node bifurcation in which new attractors and saddle points emerge, including their basins of attraction. Furthermore, we study the detectability of those bifurcations by monitoring single trajectories in state space and find that depending on the rate of environmental parameter drift, such saddle-node bifurcations might be masked or hidden, and they can only be detected if a critical rate of environmental drift is crossed. This analysis reveals that unstable states of saddle type are the organizing centers of the global dynamics in non-autonomous multistable systems and as such need much more attention in future studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Atmospheric blocking is a synoptic-scale phenomenon that consists in an obstruction of the normal easterly progression of weather patterns in the midlatitudes, leading to persistent atmospheric conditions sometimes associated with extreme weather. State-of-the-art climate models systematically underestimate winter atmospheric-blocking frequency, especially over Europe. This is often attributed to a poor representation of small-scale processes that are fundamental for the onset and maintenance of blocking events. Here, we explore how the implementation of two stochastic parameterizations, namely the stochastically perturbed parameterization tendencies (SPPTs) and the stochastic kinetic energy backscatter (SKEB) schemes, influences the representation of Northern Hemisphere winter blocking in EC-Earth3. We show that the activation of the two stochastic schemes has moderate detrimental effects on blocking representation, when assessed through a gradient reversal index. Using a zonal–blocked flow linear decomposition, we attribute such modification to changes in the mean winter atmospheric circulation, primarily manifested in a strengthening of the midlatitude jet stream and an intensification of the Hadley cell. Ultimately, an analysis of the meridional transport of zonal momentum by stationary and transient eddies reveals that these circulation differences arise from changes in tropical stationary-eddy activity. Our findings reconnect with earlier literature on similar experiments and suggest that the activation of stochastic parameterizations may require a retuning of the model to account for the resulting significant changes in the mean atmospheric circulation.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric regime transitions are highly impactful as drivers of extreme weather events, but pose two formidable modeling challenges: predicting the next event (weather forecasting) and characterizing the statistics of events of a given severity (the risk climatology). Each event has a different duration and spatial structure, making it hard to define an objective “average event.” We argue here that transition path theory (TPT), a stochastic process framework, is an appropriate tool for the task. We demonstrate TPT’s capacities on a wave–mean flow model of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) developed by Holton and Mass, which is idealized enough for transparent TPT analysis but complex enough to demonstrate computational scalability. Whereas a recent article (Finkel et al. 2021) studied near-term SSW predictability, the present article uses TPT to link predictability to long-term SSW frequency. This requires not only forecasting forward in time from an initial condition, but also backward in time to assess the probability of the initial conditions themselves. TPT enables one to condition the dynamics on the regime transition occurring, and thus visualize its physical drivers with a vector field called the reactive current. The reactive current shows that before an SSW, dissipation and stochastic forcing drive a slow decay of vortex strength at lower altitudes. The response of upper-level winds is late and sudden, occurring only after the transition is almost complete from a probabilistic point of view. This case study demonstrates that TPT quantities, visualized in a space of physically meaningful variables, can help one understand the dynamics of regime transitions.},

  abstract = {Rare events arising in nonlinear atmospheric dynamics remain hard to predict and attribute. We address the problem of forecasting rare events in a prototypical example, sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). Approximately once every other winter, the boreal stratospheric polar vortex rapidly breaks down, shifting midlatitude surface weather patterns for months. We focus on two key quantities of interest: the probability of an SSW occurring, and the expected lead time if it does occur, as functions of initial condition. These optimal forecasts concretely measure the event’s progress. Direct numerical simulation can estimate them in principle but is prohibitively expensive in practice: each rare event requires a long integration to observe, and the cost of each integration grows with model complexity. We describe an alternative approach using integrations that are short compared to the time scale of the warming event. We compute the probability and lead time efficiently by solving equations involving the transition operator, which encodes all information about the dynamics. We relate these optimal forecasts to a small number of interpretable physical variables, suggesting optimal measurements for forecasting. We illustrate the methodology on a prototype SSW model developed by Holton and Mass and modified by stochastic forcing. While highly idealized, this model captures the essential nonlinear dynamics of SSWs and exhibits the key forecasting challenge: the dramatic separation in time scales between a single event and the return time between successive events. Our methodology is designed to fully exploit high-dimensional data from models and observations, and has the potential to identify detailed predictors of many complex rare events in meteorology.},

  abstract = {Many rare weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, and floods, dramatically impact human life. To accurately forecast these events and characterize their climatology requires specialized mathematical techniques to fully leverage the limited data that are available. Here we describe transition path theory (TPT), a framework originally developed for molecular simulation, and argue that it is a useful paradigm for developing mechanistic understanding of rare climate events. TPT provides a method to calculate statistical properties of the paths into the event. As an initial demonstration of the utility of TPT, we analyze a low-order model of sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), a dramatic disturbance to the polar vortex that can induce extreme cold spells at the surface in the midlatitudes. SSW events pose a major challenge for seasonal weather prediction because of their rapid, complex onset and development. Climate models struggle to capture the long-term statistics of SSW, owing to their diversity and intermittent nature. We use a stochastically forced Holton–Mass-type model with two stable states, corresponding to radiative equilibrium and a vacillating SSW-like regime. In this stochastic bistable setting, from certain probabilistic forecasts TPT facilitates estimation of dominant transition pathways and return times of transitions. These ‘‘dynamical statistics’’ are obtained by solving partial differential equations in the model’s phase space. With future application to more complex models, TPT and its constituent quantities promise to improve the predictability of extreme weather events through both generation and principled evaluation of forecasts.},

Stochastic methods are used as subgrid‐scale parameterizations (SSPs) as well as for model error representation, uncertainty quantification, data assimilation, and ensemble prediction. The need to use stochastic approaches in weather and climate models arises because we still cannot resolve all necessary processes and scales in comprehensive numerical weather and climate prediction models. In many practical applications one is mainly interested in the largest and potentially predictable scales and not necessarily in the small and fast scales. For instance, reduced order models can simulate and predict large‐scale modes. Statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory suggest that in reduced order models the impact of unresolved degrees of freedom can be represented by suitable combinations of deterministic and stochastic components and non‐Markovian (memory) terms. Stochastic approaches in numerical weather and climate prediction models also lead to the reduction of model biases. Hence, there is a clear need for systematic stochastic approaches in weather and climate modeling. In this review, we present evidence for stochastic effects in laboratory experiments. Then we provide an overview of stochastic climate theory from an applied mathematics perspective. We also survey the current use of stochastic methods in comprehensive weather and climate prediction models and show that stochastic parameterizations have the potential to remedy many of the current biases in these comprehensive models.

The structure of this variability, however, is not arbitrary. Over certain spatial and temporal ranges, it can be described by scaling relationships in the form of power laws in probability density distributions and autocorrelation functions. These scaling relationships can be quantified by scaling exponents which measure how the variability changes across scales and how the intensity changes with frequency of occurrence. Scaling determines the relative magnitudes and persistence of natural climate fluctuations. Here, we review various scaling mechanisms and their relevance for the climate system. We show observational evidence of scaling and discuss the application of scaling properties and methods in trend detection, climate sensitivity analyses, and climate prediction.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Climate variables are related over long times and large distances. This shows up as correlations for averages on long intervals or between distant areas. An important finding is that the majority of correlations in climate can be described by a simple mathematical relationship. We present such correlations for temperature on long times. Similarly, the intensity of precipitation events depends on their frequency in a simple manner. A useful concept is scaling where a scale denotes the width of an average. Scaling says that averages on different scales are related by a simple function—mathematically, this is a power law with the scaling exponent as a characteristic number.

  abstract = {A critical question in the global warming debate concerns the causes of the observed trends of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) atmospheric circulation over recent decades. Secular trends have been identified in the frequency of occurrence of circulation regimes, namely the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the hemispheric wave-3 pattern which is associated with blocking. Previous studies into the causes of these secular trends have either been purely model based, have not included observational forcing data or have mixed external forcing with indices of internal climate variability impeding a systematic and unbiased attribution of the causes of the secular trends. Most model studies also focused mainly on the austral summer season. However, the changes to the storm tracks have occurred in all seasons and particularly in the austral winter and early spring when midlatitude blocking is most active and stratospheric ozone should not play a role. Here we systematically attribute the secular trends over the recent decades using a non-stationary clustering method applied to both reanalysis and observational forcing data from all seasons. While most previous studies emphasized the importance of stratospheric ozone depletion in causing austral summer SH circulation trends, we show observational evidence that anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations have been the major driver of these secular trends in the SAM and blocking when all seasons are considered. Our results suggest that the recovery of the ozone hole might delay the signal of global warming less strongly than previously thought and that effects from all seasons are likely crucial in understanding the causes of the secular trends.},

  abstract = {The study of transport and mixing processes in dynamical systems is particularly important for the analysis of mathematical models of physical systems. Barriers to transport, which mitigate mixing, are currently the subject of intense study. In the autonomous setting, the use of transfer operators (Perron–Frobenius operators) to identify invariant and almost-invariant sets has been particularly successful. In the nonautonomous (time-dependent) setting, coherent sets, a time-parameterised family of minimally dispersive sets, are a natural extension of almost-invariant sets. The present work introduces a new analytic transfer operator construction that enables the calculation of finite-time coherent sets (sets are that minimally dispersive over a finite time interval). This new construction also elucidates the role of diffusion in the calculation and we show how properties such as the spectral gap and the regularity of singular vectors scale with noise amplitude. The construction can also be applied to general Markov processes on continuous state space.},

Many existing approaches rely on ensembles to generate information from the external forcings, making them unsuitable to study natural systems where only a single realization is observed. A prominent example is climate dynamics, where an objective identification of signals in the observational record attributable to natural variability and climate change is crucial for making climate projections for the coming decades. Here, we show that operator-theoretic techniques previously developed to identify slowly decorrelating observables of autonomous dynamical systems provide a powerful means for identifying nonlinear trends and persistent cycles of non-autonomous systems using data from a               single               trajectory of the system.

Yet, despite this dynamical complexity, climate dynamics is known to exhibit coherent modes of variability. A primary example is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the dominant mode of interannual (3–5 yr) variability in the climate system. The objective and robust characterization of this and other important phenomena presents a long-standing challenge in Earth system science, the resolution of which would lead to improved scientific understanding and prediction of climate dynamics, as well as assessment of their impacts on human and natural systems. Here, we show that the spectral theory of dynamical systems, combined with techniques from data science, provides an effective means for extracting coherent modes of climate variability from high-dimensional model and observational data, requiring no frequency prefiltering, but recovering multiple timescales and their interactions. Lifecycle composites of ENSO are shown to improve upon results from conventional indices in terms of dynamical consistency and physical interpretability. In addition, the role of combination modes between ENSO and the annual cycle in ENSO diversity is elucidated.},

Such regression models are capable of forecasting full probability distributions and correcting for ensemble errors in the mean and variance. To estimate the corresponding regression coefficients, minimization of the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) has widely been used in meteorological postprocessing studies and has often been found to yield more calibrated forecasts compared to maximum likelihood estimation. From a theoretical perspective, both estimators are consistent and should lead to similar results, provided the correct distribution assumption about empirical data. Differences between the estimated values indicate a wrong specification of the regression model. This study compares the two estimators for probabilistic temperature forecasting with nonhomogeneous regression, where results show discrepancies for the classical Gaussian assumption. The heavy-tailed logistic and Student’s t distributions can improve forecast performance in terms of sharpness and calibration, and lead to only minor differences between the estimators employed. Finally, a simulation study confirms the importance of appropriate distribution assumptions and shows that for a correctly specified model the maximum likelihood estimator is slightly more efficient than the CRPS estimator.},

Observational and modeling studies have used a variety of metrics to quantify jet waviness. These studies show conflicting changes in jet waviness depending on the metric used and period examined. Here, we evaluate common metrics for dry idealized model simulations in which we apply polar warming of varying depth and meridional extent. In all simulations, polar warming increases the spatial extent of jet meanders, but reduces the magnitudes of ridges and troughs within the wave. As a result, geometric and anomaly-amplitude measures of jet waviness can yield opposing responses. This contrast between metrics is particularly evident when warming extends into the midlatitudes. In all simulations, midlatitude temperature anomalies weaken as the poles warm, suggesting that a wavier jet need not imply stronger temperature extremes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This article examines the first‐guess (FG) departures of microwave imager radiances assimilated in all‐sky conditions (i.e. clear, cloudy and precipitating). Agreement between FG and observations is good in clear skies, with error standard deviations around 2 K, but in heavy cloud or precipitation errors increase to 20 K. The forecast model is not good at predicting cloud and precipitation with exactly the right intensity or location. This leads to apparently non‐Gaussian behaviour, both heteroscedasticity, i.e. an increase in error with cloud amount, and boundedness, i.e. the size of errors is close to the geophysical range of the observations, which runs from clear to fully cloudy. However, the dependence of FG departure standard deviations on the mean cloud amount is predictable. Using this dependence to normalise the FG departures gives an error distribution that is close to Gaussian. Thus if errors are treated correctly, all‐sky observations can be assimilated successfully under the assumption of Gaussianity on which assimilation systems are based. This ‘symmetric’ error model can be used to provide a robust threshold quality‐control check and to determine the size of observation errors for all‐sky assimilation. In practice, however, this ‘observation’ error is being used to account for the model's difficulty in forecasting cloud, which really comes from errors in the background and in the forecast model. Hence in future it will be necessary to improve the representation of background and model error. Separately, symmetric cloud amount is recommended as a predictor for bias correction schemes, avoiding the sampling problems associated with ‘asymmetric’ predictors like the FG cloud amount.

The scientific problems posed by the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere – along with the land surface and biota that interact with them – are central to major socioeconomic and political concerns in the 21st century. It is natural, therefore, that a certain impatience should prevail in attempting to solve these problems. The point of a review paper published in this journal in 2001 was that one should proceed with all diligence but not excessive haste, namely “festina lente”, i.e., “to hurry in a measured way”. The earlier paper traced the necessary progress through the solutions of 10 problems, starting with “What can we predict beyond 1~week, for how long, and by what methods?” and ending with “Can we achieve enlightened climate control of our planet by the end of the century?” A unified framework was proposed to deal with these problems in succession, from the shortest to the longest timescale, i.e., from weeks to centuries and millennia. The framework is that of dynamical systems theory, with an emphasis on successive bifurcations and the ergodic theory of nonlinear systems, on the one hand, and on pursuing this approach across a hierarchy of climate models, from the simplest, highly idealized ones to the most detailed ones. Here, we revisit some of these problems, 20~years later,1 and extend the framework to coupled climate–economy modeling.},

Certain gross flow features recur, however, after times of the order of 10–50 days, giving hope for their prediction. Over the last two decades, numerous attempts have been made to predict these recurrent features. The attempts have involved, on the one hand, systematic improvements in numerical weather prediction by increasing the spatial resolution and physical faithfulness in the detailed models used for this prediction. On the other hand, theoretical attempts motivated by the same goal have involved the study of the large-scale atmospheric motions' phase space and the inhomogeneities therein. These “coarse-graining” studies have addressed observed as well as simulated atmospheric data sets. Two distinct approaches have been used in these studies: the episodic or intermittent and the oscillatory or periodic. The intermittency approach describes multiple-flow (or weather) regimes, their persistence and recurrence, and the Markov chain of transitions among them. The periodicity approach studies intraseasonal oscillations, with periods of 15–70 days, and their predictability. We review these two approaches, “particles” vs. “waves,” in the quantum physics analogy alluded to in the title of this article, discuss their complementarity, and outline unsolved problems.},

  abstract = {The most important sources of atmospheric moisture at the global scale are herein identified, both oceanic and terrestrial, and a characterization is made of how continental regions are influenced by water from different moisture source regions. The methods used to establish source‐sink relationships of atmospheric water vapor are reviewed, and the advantages and caveats associated with each technique are discussed. The methods described include analytical and box models, numerical water vapor tracers, and physical water vapor tracers (isotopes). In particular, consideration is given to the wide range of recently developed Lagrangian techniques suitable both for evaluating the origin of water that falls during extreme precipitation events and for establishing climatologies of moisture source‐sink relationships. As far as oceanic sources are concerned, the important role of the subtropical northern Atlantic Ocean provides moisture for precipitation to the largest continental area, extending from Mexico to parts of Eurasia, and even to the South American continent during the Northern Hemisphere winter. In contrast, the influence of the southern Indian Ocean and North Pacific Ocean sources extends only over smaller continental areas. The South Pacific and the Indian Ocean represent the principal source of moisture for both Australia and Indonesia. Some landmasses only receive moisture from the evaporation that occurs in the same hemisphere (e.g., northern Europe and eastern North America), while others receive moisture from both hemispheres with large seasonal variations (e.g., northern South America). The monsoonal regimes in India, tropical Africa, and North America are provided with moisture from a large number of regions, highlighting the complexities of the global patterns of precipitation. Some very important contributions are also seen from relatively small areas of ocean, such as the Mediterranean Basin (important for Europe and North Africa) and the Red Sea, which provides water for a large area between the Gulf of Guinea and Indochina (summer) and between the African Great Lakes and Asia (winter). The geographical regions of Eurasia, North and South America, and Africa, and also the internationally important basins of the Mississippi, Amazon, Congo, and Yangtze Rivers, are also considered, as is the importance of terrestrial sources in monsoonal regimes. The role of atmospheric rivers, and particularly their relationship with extreme events, is discussed. Droughts can be caused by the reduced supply of water vapor from oceanic moisture source regions. Some of the implications of climate change for the hydrological cycle are also reviewed, including changes in water vapor concentrations, precipitation, soil moisture, and aridity. It is important to achieve a combined diagnosis of moisture sources using all available information, including stable water isotope measurements. A summary is given of the major research questions that remain unanswered, including (1) the lack of a full understanding of how moisture sources influence precipitation isotopes; (2) the stationarity of moisture sources over long periods; (3) the way in which possible changes in intensity (where evaporation exceeds precipitation to a greater of lesser degree), and the locations of the sources, (could) affect the distribution of continental precipitation in a changing climate; and (4) the role played by the main modes of climate variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation or the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, in the variability of the moisture source regions, as well as a full evaluation of the moisture transported by low‐level jets and atmospheric rivers.           ,              Key Points                                                                Review of the most important sources of atmospheric moisture at the global scale                                                     Review the methods to establish source‐sink relationships of atmospheric vapor                                                     Discussion of the role of climate change in changes in the moisture transport},

Here we review the basic results of ergodic theory, with a specific reference to the implications of Oseledets’ theorem for the properties of the CLVs. We then present a detailed description of a “dynamical” algorithm to compute the CLVs and show that it generically converges exponentially in time. We also discuss its numerical performance and compare it with other algorithms presented in literature. We finally illustrate how CLVs can be used to quantify deviations from hyperbolicity with reference to a dissipative system (a chain of H ́enon maps) and a Hamiltonian model (a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain).},

  abstract = {We employ the framework of the Koopman operator and dynamic mode decomposition to devise a computationally cheap and easily implementable method to detect transient dynamics and regime changes in time series. We argue that typically transient dynamics experiences the full state space dimension with subsequent fast relaxation towards the attractor. In equilibrium, on the other hand, the dynamics evolves on a slower time scale on a lower dimensional attractor. The reconstruction error of a dynamic mode decomposition is used to monitor the inability of the time series to resolve the fast relaxation towards the attractor as well as the effective dimension of the dynamics. We illustrate our method by detecting transient dynamics in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We further apply our method to atmospheric reanalysis data; our diagnostics detects the transition from a predominantly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to a predominantly positive NAO around 1970, as well as the recently found regime change in the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation around 1970.},

Generalizations, extensions, and improvements of the minimum action methods are proposed. These algorithms are tested on example problems which illustrate several common difficulties which arise, e.g., when the forcing is degenerate or multiplicative, or the systems are infinite-dimensional. Generalizations to processes driven by non-Gaussian noises or random initial data and parameters are also discussed, along with the connection between the LDT-based approach reviewed here and other methods, such as stochastic field theory and optimal control. Finally, the integration of this approach in importance sampling methods using, e.g., genealogical algorithms, is explored.},

  abstract = {Despite huge progress made, state‐of‐the‐art numerical weather prediction systems occasionally experience severe forecast busts for the large‐scale extratropical circulation. This study investigates one of the most severe forecast busts for Europe in the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts integrated forecasting system (IFS) in recent years. The forecast bust occurred in March 2016 and was associated with a misforecast of the onset of a blocking regime. We investigate the evolution of the forecast error in the IFS ensemble by employing a potential vorticity perspective combined with Lagrangian diagnostics. We show that the error grows rapidly from an initially small perturbation in the detailed structure of an upper‐level trough near Newfoundland. This trough triggers strong diabatic warm conveyor belt activity in the North Atlantic region. The misrepresentation of this warm conveyor belt activity in the ensemble forecast amplifies the initial condition error and communicates it downstream into Europe. Specifically, the ensemble underestimates poleward warm conveyor belt ascent and associated warm conveyor belt outflow into high latitudes. Instead, all ensemble members forecast too strong warm conveyor belt outflow further to the south, which ultimately results in a wrong forecast of the upper‐level Rossby wave pattern over Europe. This case study shows that warm conveyor belts and the associated latent heat release in slantwise ascending air can trigger a nonlinear feedback mechanism that amplifies forecast error strongly and communicates it into regions far downstream. It corroborates the fact that multiscale interactions and moist‐and dry‐dynamical processes ranging from microphysical to synoptic scales need to be represented accurately in numerical weather prediction, in order to predict the extratropical large‐scale circulation correctly.},

On weekly timescales, variability is related to long-lasting weather  conditions, called weather regimes2–5, which can cause lulls  with a loss of wind power across neighbouring countries6. Here we show that weather regimes provide a meteorological explanation for multi-day fluctuations in Europe’s wind power and can help guide new deployment pathways that minimize this variability. Mean generation during different regimes currently ranges from 22 GW to 44 GW and is expected to triple by 2030 with current planning strategies. However, balancing future wind capacity across regions with contrasting inter-regime behaviour—specifically deploying in the Balkans instead of the North Sea—would almost eliminate these output variations, maintain mean generation, and increase fleet-wide minimum output. Solar photovoltaics could balance low-wind regimes locally, but only by expanding current capacity tenfold. New deployment strategies based on an understanding of continent-scale wind patterns and pan-European collaboration could enable a high share of wind energy whilst minimizing the negative impacts of output variability.},

Here we show that the rise of images online significantly exacerbates gender bias, both in its statistical prevalence and its psychological impact. We examine the gender associations of 3,495 social categories (such as ‘nurse’ or ‘banker’) in more than one million images from Google, Wikipedia and Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and in billions of words from these platforms. We find that gender bias is consistently more prevalent in images than text for both female- and male-typed categories. We also show that the documented underrepresentation of women online               13–18               is substantially worse in images than in text, public opinion and US census data. Finally, we conducted a nationally representative, preregistered experiment that shows that googling for images rather than textual descriptions of occupations amplifies gender bias in participants’ beliefs. Addressing the societal effect of this large-scale shift towards visual communication will be essential for developing a fair and inclusive future for the internet.},

These extremes were accompanied by a low-high-low pressure system known as Omega pattern. However, the capability of climate models to reproduce such complex extremes and related atmospheric circulations is still unclear. By introducing a novel index, here we show that the 2023 event was not unique yet most extreme in recent decades. Using ensemble boosting, the fully-coupled Community Earth System Model 2 can reproduce such co-occurring extremes with remarkably similar configurations of the large-scale flow and even higher heatwave/rainfall than observed. This suggests that similar compounding events with even stronger intensity could, in principle, occur. However, such spatially compounding events are too rare in the model relative to reanalysis, suggesting that the model may underestimate their future occurrence in a warming climate.},

Winters with clusters of more frequent blocking between Greenland and western Europe correspond to a warmer, more saline subpolar ocean. The correspondence between blocked westerly winds and warm ocean holds in recent decadal episodes (especially 1996 to 2010). It also describes much longer time scale Atlantic multidecadal ocean variability (AMV), including the extreme pre–greenhouse-gas northern warming of the 1930s to 1960s. The space-time structure of the wind forcing associated with a blocked regime leads to weaker ocean gyres and weaker heat exchange, both of which contribute to the warm phase of AMV.},

Free from the uncertainties of single trajectories, LCSs frame, quantify, and even forecast key aspects of material transport. Several diagnostic quantities have been proposed to visualize LCSs. More recent mathematical approaches identify LCSs precisely through their impact on fluid deformation. This review focuses on the latter developments, illustrating their applications to geophysical fluid dynamics.},

Using continuation software, the origin of these clusters was also investigated. The flow of model trajectories can be approximated using UPOs, a concept known as shadowing. Here, we extend that idea to look at the number of times a UPO shadows a model trajectory over a fixed time period, which we call cumulative shadowing. This concept was used to identify sets of UPOs that describe different life cycles of each cluster. The different regions of the attractor that were identified in the current work, and the transitions between these regions, are linked to specific atmospheric features known as atmospheric blocks.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Climate and weather constitute a typical example where high dimensional and complex phenomena meet. The atmospheric system is the result of highly complex interactions between many degrees of freedom or modes. In order to gain insight in understanding the dynamical/physical behaviour involved it is useful to attempt to understand their interactions in terms of a much smaller number of prominent modes of variability. This has led to the development by atmospheric researchers of methods that give a space display and a time display of large space‐time atmospheric data.             Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) were first used in meteorology in the late 1940s. The method, which decomposes a space‐time field into spatial patterns and associated time indices, contributed much in advancing our knowledge of the atmosphere. However, since the atmosphere contains all sorts of features, e.g. stationary and propagating, EOFs are unable to provide a full picture. For example, EOFs tend, in general, to be difficult to interpret because of their geometric properties, such as their global feature, and their orthogonality in space and time. To obtain more localised features, modifications, e.g. rotated EOFs (REOFs), have been introduced. At the same time, because these methods cannot deal with propagating features, since they only use spatial correlation of the field, it was necessary to use both spatial and time information in order to identify such features. Extended and complex EOFs were introduced to serve that purpose.             Because of the importance of EOFs and closely related methods in atmospheric science, and because the existing reviews of the subject are slightly out of date, there seems to be a need to update our knowledge by including new developments that could not be presented in previous reviews. This review proposes to achieve precisely this goal. The basic theory of the main types of EOFs is reviewed, and a wide range of applications using various data sets are also provided.

Such low‐frequency variability is governed to a large extent by nonlinear dynamics and, hence, is chaotic. A useful aspect of this low‐frequency circulation is that it can often be described by just a few quasi‐stationary regime states, broadly defined as recurrent or persistent large‐scale structures, that exert a significant impact on the probability of experiencing extreme surface weather conditions. We review a variety of techniques for identifying circulation regimes from reanalysis and numerical model output. While various techniques often yield similar regime circulation patterns, they offer different perspectives on the regimes. The regimes themselves are manifest in planetary scale patterns. They affect the structure of synoptic scale patterns. Extratropical flow regimes have been identified in simplified atmospheric models and comprehensive coupled climate models and in reanalysis data sets. It is an ongoing challenge to accurately model these regime states, and high horizontal resolutions are often needed to accurately reproduce them. The regime paradigm helps to understand the response to external forcing on a variety of time scales, has been helpful in categorizing a large number of weather types and their effect on local conditions, and is useful in downscaling. Despite their usefulness, there is a debate on the “nonequivocal” and systematic existence of these nonlinear circulation regimes.

  abstract = {Flow in geophysical fluids is commonly summarized by coherent streams (e.g., conveyor belt flows in extratropical cyclones or jet streaks in the upper troposphere). Typically, parcel trajectories are calculated from the flow field and subjective thresholds are used to distinguish coherent streams of interest. This methodology contribution develops a more objective approach to distinguish coherent airstreams within extratropical cyclones. Agglomerative clustering is applied to trajectories along with a method to identify the optimal number of cluster classes. The methodology is applied to trajectories associated with the low-level jets of a well-studied extratropical cyclone. For computational efficiency, a constraint that trajectories must pass through these jet regions is applied prior to clustering; the partitioning into different airstreams is then performed by the agglomerative clustering. It is demonstrated that the methodology can identify the salient flow structures of cyclones: the warm and cold conveyor belts. A test focusing on the airstreams terminating at the tip of the bent-back front further demonstrates the success of the method in that it can distinguish finescale flow structure such as descending sting-jet airstreams.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric blocking events are known to locally explain a large part of climate variability. However, despite their relevance, many current climate models still struggle to represent the observed blocking statistics. In this study, simulations of the global climate model EC-Earth are analysed with respect to atmospheric blocking. Seventeen simulations map the uncertainty space defined by the three-model characteristics: atmospheric resolution, physical parameterization and complexity of atmosphere–ocean interaction, namely an atmosphere coupled to an ocean model or forced by surface data. Representation of the real-world statistics is obtained from reanalyses ERA-20C, JRA-55 and ERA-Interim which agree on Northern Hemisphere blocking characteristics. Blocking events are detected on a central blocking latitude which is individually determined for each simulation. The frequency of blocking events tends to be underestimated relative to ERA-Interim over the Atlantic and western Eurasia in winter and overestimated during spring months. However, only few model setups show statistically significant differences compared to ERA-Interim which can be explained by the large inter-annual variability of blocking. Results indicate slightly larger biases relative to ERA-Interim in coupled than in atmosphere-only models but differences between the two are not statistically significant. Although some resolution dependence is present in spring, the signal is weak and only statistically significant if the physical parameterizations of the model are improved simultaneously. Winter blocking is relatively more sensitive to physical parameterizations, and this signal is robust in both atmosphere-only and coupled simulations, although stronger in the latter. Overall, the model can capture blocking frequency well despite biases in representing the mean state of geopotential height over this area. Blocking signatures of geopotential height are represented more similar to ERA-Interim and only weak sensitivities to model characteristics remain.},

  abstract = {Localised regions of negative potential vorticity (PV) are frequently seen on the equatorward flank of the upper-tropospheric jet streams in analysis and forecast products. Their positioning, on the anticyclonic side of the jet and often close to the jet core, suggest they are associated with an enhancement of jet stream maximum winds. Given that PV is generally positive in the northern hemisphere and is materially conserved under adiabatic conditions, the presence of negative PV is indicative of recent diabatic activity. However, little is understood on the mechanisms for its generation and subsequent impacts. In this paper, aircraft measurements from a recent field campaign are used to provide direct observational evidence for the presence of negative PV on the anticyclonic side of an upper-tropospheric jet. Theory is then developed to understand the process by which PV can turn negative. The key ingredient is diabatic heating in the presence of vertical wind shear, and the resulting PV anomalies are shown to always result from a flux of PV directed “down the isentropic slope”. This explains why, for the typical situation of heating in a warm conveyor belt, negative PV values appear on the equatorward side of the upper-tropospheric jet stream close to the jet core. These ideas are illustrated with a semi-geostrophic model and the processes responsible for the observed negative PV are explored using an operational forecast model with online PV tracer diagnostics. The diabatic influence on jet stream winds and shear is of interest because it is pertinent to the predictability of extreme jet stream events and associated flight-level turbulence, and is crucial to the propagation of Rossby waves at tropopause level, development of midlatitude weather systems and their subsequent impacts at the surface.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Atmospheric blocking describes a situation in which a stationary and persistent anticyclone blocks the eastward propagation of weather systems in the midlatitudes and can lead to extreme weather events. In the North Atlantic–European region, blocking contributes to life cycles of weather regimes which are recurrent, quasi-stationary, and persistent patterns of the large-scale circulation. Despite progress in blocking theory over the last decades, we are still lacking a comprehensive, process-based conceptual understanding of blocking dynamics. Here we combine three different perspectives on so-called “blocked” weather regimes, namely the commonly used Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives, complemented by a novel quasi-Lagrangian perspective. Within the established framework of midlatitude potential vorticity (PV) thinking, the joint consideration of the three perspectives enables a comprehensive picture of the dynamics and quantifies the importance of dry and moist processes during a blocked weather regime life cycle. We apply the diagnostic framework to a European blocking weather regime life cycle in March 2016, which was associated with a severe forecast bust in the North Atlantic–European region. The three perspectives highlight the importance of moist processes during the onset or maintenance of the blocked weather regime. The Eulerian perspective, which identifies the processes contributing to the onset and decay of the regime, indicates that dry quasi-barotropic wave dynamics and especially the eastward advection of PV anomalies (PVAs) into the North Atlantic–European region dominate the onset of the regime pattern. By tracking the negative upper-tropospheric PVA associated with the “block”, the quasi-Lagrangian view reveals, for the same period, abrupt amplification due to moist processes. This is in good agreement with the Lagrangian perspective indicating that a large fraction of air parcels that end up in the negative PVA experience diabatic heating. Overall, the study shows that important contributions to the development take place outside of the region in which the blocked weather regime eventually establishes, and that a joint consideration of different perspectives is important in order not to miss processes, in particular moist-baroclinic dynamics, contributing to a blocked regime life cycle.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Blocking over Greenland stands out in comparison to blocking in other regions, as it favors accelerated Greenland Ice Sheet melting and has substantial impacts on surface weather in adjacent regions, particularly in Europe and North America. Climate models notoriously underestimate the frequency of blocking over Greenland in historical periods, but the reasons for this are not entirely clear, as we are still lacking a full dynamical understanding of Greenland blocking from formation through maintenance to decay. This study investigates the dynamics of blocking life cycles over Greenland based on ERA5 reanalysis data from 1979–2021. A year-round weather regime definition allows us to identify Greenland blocking as consistent life cycles with an objective onset, maximum, and decay stage. By applying a new quasi-Lagrangian potential vorticity~(PV) perspective, following the negative, upper-tropospheric PV~anomalies~(PVAs−) associated with the block, we examine and quantify the contribution from different physical processes, including dry and moist dynamics, to the evolution of the PVA− amplitude. We find that PVAs− linked to blocking do not form locally over Greenland but propagate into the region along two distinct pathways (termed “upstream” and “retrogression”) during the days before the onset. The development of PVAs− differs more between the pathways than between seasons. Moist processes play a key role in the amplification of PVAs− before the onset and are linked to midlatitude warm conveyor belts. Interestingly, we find moist processes supporting the westward propagation of retrograding PVAs− from Europe, too, previously thought to be a process dominated by dry-barotropic Rossby wave propagation. After onset, moist processes remain the main contribution to PVA− amplification and maintenance. However, moist processes weaken markedly after the maximum stage, and dry processes, i.e.,~barotropic, nonlinear wave dynamics, dominate the decay of the PVAs− accompanied by a general decrease in blocking area. Our results corroborate the importance of moist processes in the formation and maintenance of Greenland blocking and suggest that a correct representation of moist processes might help reduce forecast errors linked to blocking in numerical weather prediction models and blocking biases in climate models.},

We find that blocks increase extreme wildfire danger by a factor of 4–5 in frequently blocked areas, and up to 30 in some Northern Hemisphere regions. We also find a significant though weaker link between blocks and satellite‐observed fires in the Arctic regions during summer. The relationship between blocks and wildfire danger and occurrence varies by season and region but is strongest over the Arctic regions. These results establish a quantitative link between persistent weather patterns and wildfires that might be exploited for sub‐seasonal forecasting. In addition, it demonstrates that atmospheric blocks are important atmospheric processes to increase wildfire danger.           ,              Key Points                                                                Extreme fire weather danger and satellite‐observed fires are frequently co‐located with atmospheric blocks at higher latitudes                                                     Blocks increase the odds of extreme fire weather danger by a factor of 4–5, reaching locally up to a 30‐fold increase                                                     The link between blocks and satellite‐observed fires is weaker and spatially more complex but is significant in the Arctic regions in summer},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing  the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of  the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This  new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards)  which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a  decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation.  In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared  to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution).  This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979  onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses  show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved  fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved  fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of  the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation,  global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and  from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match  those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

  abstract = {In recent years a number of reanalysis datasets have been published that cover the past century or more, including the ‘Twentieth Century Reanalysis’               20CRv2               and the European Reanalysis of the twentieth century               ERA‐20C               . These datasets are widely used, showing the need for, and possible benefit of, reanalysis data products designed for climate applications. The twentieth‐century reanalyses so far have assimilated only surface observations, and rely on independent estimates of monthly averaged sea‐surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations as boundary conditions. While               20CRv2               uses only observations of surface and sea‐level pressure,               ERA‐20C               additionally assimilates marine winds.                                         Here we describe an experimental reanalysis, referred to as               ERA‐PreSAT               , which covers the period 1939–1967 and also assimilates historical upper‐air data. Assessments of this dataset including comparisons with independent data show that (i) temperature biases in the Northern Hemisphere are largely reduced compared to reanalyses that assimilate surface data only, (ii) concentration of 1940s upper‐air data in the northern extratropics created a strong interhemispheric asymmetry which is likely not realistic, (iii) the forecast skill in the Northern Hemisphere has increased substantially compared to reanalyses that assimilate surface data only, (iv) day‐to‐day and (in the northern extratropics) month‐to‐month correlations with independent observations (of total column ozone, upper‐air data) increase over time, (v) interannual variability is well captured in the reanalysis, (vi) a signature of the stratospheric Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation is present as far back as the 1940s, and (vii) tropical cyclones are not well represented.                                         The generally encouraging results from the experimental               ERA‐PreSAT               reanalysis underline that early upper‐air data greatly contribute to our knowledge on the troposphere and lower stratosphere over the twentieth century.},

  abstract = {The role of clouds for radiative transfer, precipitation formation, and their interaction with atmospheric dynamics depends strongly on cloud microphysics. The parameterization of cloud microphysical processes in weather and climate models is a well-known source of uncertainties. Hence, robust quantification of this uncertainty is mandatory. Sensitivity analysis to date has typically investigated only a few model parameters. We propose algorithmic differentiation (AD) as a tool to detect the magnitude and timing at which a model state variable is sensitive to any of the hundreds of uncertain model parameters in the cloud microphysics parameterization. AD increases the computational cost by roughly a third in our simulations. We explore this methodology as the example of warm conveyor belt trajectories, that is, air parcels rising rapidly from the planetary boundary layer to the upper troposphere in the vicinity of an extratropical cyclone. Based on the information of derivatives with respect to the uncertain parameters, the ten parameters contributing most to uncertainty are selected. These uncertain parameters are mostly related to the representation of hydrometeor diameter and fall velocity, the activation of cloud condensation nuclei, and heterogeneous freezing. We demonstrate the meaningfulness of the AD-estimated sensitivities by comparing the AD results with ensemble simulations spawned at different points along the trajectories, where different parameter settings are used in the various ensemble members. The ranking of the most important parameters from these ensemble simulations is consistent with the results from AD. Thus, AD is a helpful tool for selecting parameters contributing most to cloud microphysics uncertainty.},

  abstract = {It is amusing to remark that we were so involved with matrix inversion that we probably talked of nothing else for months. Just in this period Mrs. von Neumann acquired a big, rather wild but gentle Irish Setter puppy, which she called Inverse in honor of our work! — HERMAN H. GOLDSTINE, The Computer: From Pascal to von Neumann (1972) The most computationally intensive portion of the tasks assigned to the processors is integrating the KKR matrix inverse over the first Brillouin zone. To evaluate the integral, hundreds or possibly thousands of complex double precision matrices of order between 80 and 300 must be formed and inverted. Each matrix corresponds to a different vertex of the tetrahedrons into which the Brillouin zone has been subdivided. — M. T. HEATH, G. A. GEIST, and J. B. DRAKE, Superconductivity Computations, in Early Experience with the Intel IPSC/860 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (1990) Press 1/x to invert the matrix. Note that matrix inversion can produce erroneous results if you are using ill-conditioned matrices. — HEWLETT-PACKARD, HP 48G Series User's Guide (1993) Almost anything you can do with A−1 can be done without it. — GEORGE E. FORSYTHE and CLEVE B. MOLER, Computer Solution of Linear Algebraic Systems (1967) 14.1. Use and Abuse of the Matrix Inverse To most numerical analysts, matrix inversion is a sin. Forsythe, Malcolm, and Moler put it well when they say [430, 1977, p. 31] “In the vast majority of practical computational problems, it is unnecessary and inadvisable to actually compute A−1.” The best example of a problem in which the matrix inverse should not be computed is the linear equations problem Ax = b. Computing the solution as x = A−1 × b requires 2n3 flops, assuming A−1 is computed by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP), whereas GEPP applied directly to the system costs only 2n3/3 flops. Not only is the inversion approach three times more expensive, but it is much less stable. Suppose X = A−1 is formed exactly, and that the only rounding errors are in forming x = fl(Xb). Then x \textasciicircum{} = (X + ΔX)b, where |ΔX| ≤ γn|X|, by (3.11). So A x \textasciicircum{} = A(X + ΔX)b = (I + AΔX)b, and the best possible residual bound is |b−A x ̑ | ≤ γn |A| | A−1 | |b| . For GEPP, Theorem 9.4 yields |b−A x ̑ | ≤ γ3n | L ̑ | | U ̑ | | x ̑ | . Since it is usually true that ‖ | L \textasciicircum{} ‖Û| ‖∞ ≈ ‖A‖∞ for GEPP, we see that the matrix inversion approach is likely to give a much larger residual than GEPP if A is ill conditioned and if ‖x‖∞ ≪ ‖ | A−1 | | b| ‖∞. For example, we solved fifty 25 × 25 systems Ax = b in MATLAB, where the elements of x are taken from the normal N(0, 1) distribution and A is random with κ2(A) = u−1/2 ≈ 9 × 107. As Table 14.1 shows, the inversion approach provided much larger backward errors than GEPP in this experiment. Given the inexpedience of matrix inversion, why devote a chapter to it? The answer is twofold. First, there are situations in which a matrix inverse must be computed. Examples are in statistics [63, 1974, §7.5], [806, 1984, §2.3], [834, 1989, p. 342 ff], where the inverse can convey important statistical information, in certain matrix iterations arising in eigenvalue-related problems [47, 1997], [193, 1987], [621, 1994], in the computation of matrix functions such as the square root [609, 1997] and the logarithm [231, 2001], and in numerical integrations arising in superconductivity computations [555, 1990] (see the quotation at the start of the chapter). Second, methods for matrix inversion display a wide variety of stability properties, making for instructive and challenging error analysis. (Indeed, the first major rounding error analysis to be published, that of von Neumann and Goldstine, was for matrix inversion—see §9.13).},

  abstract = {We investigate a reduced point vortex model for statistical and dynamical analyses of atmospheric blocking phenomena. Thereby, we consider High-over-low and Omega blocking as relative equilibria of two and three point vortices. Under certain conditions, such point vortex systems move westward opposing the mean westerly flow and hence can become stationary. Based on the kinematic vorticity number, two novel, independent methods, the contour and the trapezoid method, are introduced in order to identify the vortices that form the blocking pattern, their local positions and circulation magnitudes. While the contour method takes into account the observed stationarity of blocking, the trapezoid method minimizes the total circulation of the vortex system following point vortex theory. Using an instantaneous blocking index, a total number of 347 blocking periods were identified in NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis data for the Euro-Atlantic region during the time period 1990–2012. This procedure provides the basis to corroborate the applicability of the point vortex model to atmospheric blocking in a statistical framework. The calculated translation speed of point vortex systems associated with the atmospheric blocking appears to match the zonal mean velocity reasonably well. This model explains the stationary behaviour of blocking patterns. A comparison between the theoretical and a statistical model further reveals that the circulation of the blocking high follows the principles of the point vortex model to a large extent. However, the low-pressure systems behave more variable. Moreover, the stability of point vortex equilibria is analysed regarding the relative distances by considering linear stability analysis and simulations. This reveals that the point vortex blocking model corresponds to an unstable saddle point. Furthermore, we take viscosity and a Brownian motion into account to simulate the influence of the smaller, subgrid-scale disturbances. As a result, a clustering near the equilibrium state emerges indicating the persistence of the atmospheric blocking pattern.},

Here, we answer this question for wintertime Atlantic-European regimes. We argue that dynamical systems theory applied to a refined regime definition provides strong evidence in support of most weather regimes being physically meaningful.

  abstract = {Abstract             While the benefits of ensemble techniques over deterministic numerical weather predictions (NWP) are now widely recognized, the prospects of ensemble prediction systems (EPS) at high computational resolution are still largely unclear. Difficulties arise due to the poor knowledge of the mechanisms promoting rapid perturbation growth and propagation, as well as the role of nonlinearities. In this study, the dynamics associated with the growth and propagation of initial uncertainties is investigated by means of real-case high-resolution (cloud resolving) NWP integrations. The considered case is taken from the Mesoscale Alpine Programme intensive observing period 3 (MAP IOP3) and involves convection of intermediate intensity. To assess the underlying mechanisms and the degree of linearity upon the predictability of the flow, vastly different initial perturbation methodologies are compared, while all simulations use identical lateral boundary conditions to mimic a perfectly predictable synoptic-scale flow.             Comparison of the perturbation methodologies indicates that the ensuing patterns of ensemble spread converge within 11 h, irrespective of the initial perturbations employed. All methodologies pinpoint the same meso-beta-scale regions of the flow as suffering from predictability limitations. This result reveals the important role of nonlinearities. Analysis also shows that hot spots of error growth can quickly (1–2 h after initialization) develop far away from the initial perturbations. This rapid radiation of the initial uncertainties throughout the computational domain is due to both sound and gravity waves, followed by the triggering and/or growth of perturbations over regions of convective instability. The growth of the uncertainties is then limited by saturation effects, which in turn are controlled by the larger-scale atmospheric environment.             From a practical point of view, it is suggested that the combined effects of rapid propagation, sizeable amplification, and inherent nonlinearities may pose severe difficulties for the design of EPS or data assimilation techniques related to high-resolution quantitative precipitation forecasting.},

  abstract = {We investigate the link between warm-temperature extremes in Europe and the persistence of largescale atmospheric-circulation patterns for both winter and summer, along with some possible physical mechanisms connecting the two. We assess atmospheric persistence, leveraging concepts from dynamical systems theory, and reconcile this approach with the more conventional meteorological views of persistence. We find that wintertime warm spells are partly associated with persistent zonal advection at the surface level but display no statistically significant persistence anomaly in the mid-troposphere. For summertime heatwaves, we find a weak yet significant link to anomalously persistent circulation patterns in the mid-troposphere, while there are few significant persistence anomalies of the surface circulation pattern. We further find no evidence of a strong warm-temperature advection signal. This suggests that other radiative and dynamical processes, for example sensible heating and adiabatic warming, as well as local effects, could play a more important role than large-scale warm-temperature advection for these events. We thus argue that persistent atmospheric configurations are not a necessary requirement for warm-temperature extremes and that the results depend to a considerable extent on region and tropospheric level.},

  abstract = {The clustering of data into physically meaningful subsets often requires assumptions regarding the number, size, or shape of the subgroups. Here, we present a new method, simultaneous coherent structure coloring (sCSC), which accomplishes the task of unsupervised clustering without a priori guidance regarding the underlying structure of the data. sCSC performs a sequence of binary splittings on the dataset such that the most dissimilar data points are required to be in separate clusters. To achieve this, we obtain a set of orthogonal coordinates along which dissimilarity in the dataset is maximized from a generalized eigenvalue problem based on the pairwise dissimilarity between the data points to be clustered. This sequence of bifurcations produces a binary tree representation of the system, from which the number of clusters in the data and their interrelationships naturally emerge. To illustrate the effectiveness of the method in the absence of a priori assumptions, we apply it to three exemplary problems in fluid dynamics. Then, we illustrate its capacity for interpretability using a high-dimensional protein folding simulation dataset. While we restrict our examples to dynamical physical systems in this work, we anticipate straightforward translation to other fields where existing analysis tools require ad hoc assumptions on the data structure, lack the interpretability of the present method, or in which the underlying processes are less accessible, such as genomics and neuroscience.},

The rationale for developing an EDA is discussed and the considerations that went into deciding the operational configuration, including resolution, ensemble size and model error formulation, are presented. Since its implementation, EDA based perturbations have been used to improve the initial perturbations for the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS): the methodology used to combine EDA-based perturbations and initial-time singular vectors and the impact of replacing the evolved singular vectors with EDA-based perturbations on the EPS performance is presented. Another important application of the EDA is to provide flow-dependent background error estimates for the deterministic 4D-Var system: the method under development and testing is described, and the significant progress that has been made in the past year is discussed.},

A control simulation with the model version operational at ECMWF during 2014/early 2015 and a simulation with new parametrizations of rain autoconversion/accretion, rain evaporation and snow riming operational since May 2015 are compared in detail. In order to investigate the impact of each microphysical process separately, the diabatic heating rate for each microphysical process and the associated change in potential vorticity (PV) is calculated and compared for the two simulations. The influence on the upper‐level ridge building and the downstream flow evolution is investigated. The changes in the microphysical parametrization led to differences in the position of the warm conveyor belt (WCB) outflow. The WCB reaches the upper troposphere with low PV values and shifts the location of the tropopause in a slightly different way in the two simulations. Although these differences are relatively small at the beginning, they are advected downstream and amplify, leading to distinct differences in the upper‐level PV pattern. These results highlight the importance of correct representation of microphysical processes for large‐scale flow features. Additionally they emphasise the need for detailed microphysical measurements in extratropical cyclones in order to better understand and constrain the microphysical processes in NWP models.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This study investigates how warm conveyor belts~(WCBs) will change in a future climate. WCBs are strongly ascending airstreams in extratropical cyclones that are responsible for most of their precipitation. In conjunction with the cloud formation, latent heat is released, which has an impact on the potential vorticity distribution and therefore on the atmospheric circulation in the middle and upper troposphere. Because of these and other impacts of WCBs, it is of great importance to investigate changes in their frequencies, regions of occurrence, and physical characteristics in a warmer climate. To this aim, future climate simulations (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 – RCP8.5 – scenario; 2091–2100) are performed with the Community Earth System Model version~1~(CESM1) and compared to present-day climate (1991–1999). Trajectories are calculated based on 6-hourly 3D~wind fields, and WCBs are identified as trajectories that ascend at least 600\,hPa in 2\,d. WCBs are represented reasonably well in terms of location and occurrence frequency compared to WCBs in the ERA-Interim reanalyses. In a future climate, WCB inflow regions in the North Pacific are systematically shifted northward in winter, which is in agreement with the northward shift of the storm track in this region. In the North Atlantic, increased frequencies are discernible in the southwest and there is a decrease to the south of Iceland. Finally, in the Southern Hemisphere, WCB frequencies increase in the South Atlantic in both seasons and to the east of South Africa and the Indian Ocean in June–July–August (JJA). These changes are partly consistent with corresponding changes in the occurrence frequencies of extratropical cyclones, i.e. the driving weather systems of WCBs. Changes are also found in the WCB characteristics, which have implications for WCB impacts in a future climate. The increase in inflow moisture in the different regions and seasons – ∼23\,\%–33\,\% (∼14\,\%–20\,\%) in winter (summer) – leads to (i)~an increase in WCB-related precipitation – ∼13\,\%–23\,\% (∼7\,\%–28\,\%) in winter (summer) – especially in the upper percentiles and thus a possible increase in extreme precipitation related to WCBs, (ii)~a strong increase in diabatic heating – ∼20\,\%–27\,\% (∼17\,\%–33\,\%) in winter (summer) – in the mid-troposphere, and (iii)~a higher outflow level – ∼10\,K (∼10–16\,K) in winter (summer) – which favours WCBs more strongly interacting with the upper-level Rossby waveguide. In summary, by investigating a distinct weather system, the WCB, and how it changes in its occurrence frequency and characteristics in a future climate, this study provides new insights into the dynamics and impacts of climate change in the extratropical storm track regions.},

  abstract = {The predictability of the atmosphere has important implications for weather prediction, because it determines what forecast problems are potentially tractable. Even though our general understanding of error growth and predictability has been increasing, relatively little is known about the detailed structure of atmospheric predictability, such as how it varies between climate regions. The present study addresses this issue by exploring error growth and predictability in three latitude zones, using model output from a previous global storm-resolving predictability experiment by Judt published in 2018. It was determined that the tropics have longer predictability than the middle latitudes and polar regions (tropics, .20 days; middle latitudes and polar regions, a little over 2 weeks). Each latitude zone had distinct error growth characteristics, and error growth was broadly consistent with the underlying dynamics of each zone. Evidence suggests that equatorial waves play a role in the comparatively long predictability of the tropics; specifically, equatorial waves seem to be less prone to error growth than middle-latitude baroclinic disturbances. Even though the generality of the findings needs to be assessed in future studies, the overall conclusions agree with previous work in that current numerical weather prediction procedures have not reached the limits of atmospheric predictability, especially in the tropics. One way to exploit tropical predictability is to reduce model error, for example, by using global storm-resolving models instead of conventional models that parameterize convection.},

  abstract = {Global convection-permitting models enable weather prediction from local to planetary scales and are therefore often expected to transform the weather prediction enterprise. This potential, however, depends on the predictability of the atmosphere, which was explored here through identical twin experiments using the Model for Prediction Across Scales. The simulations were produced on a quasi-uniform 4-km mesh, which allowed the illumination of error growth from convective to global scales. During the first two days, errors grew through moist convection and other mesoscale processes, and the character of the error growth resembled the case of k25/3 turbulence. Between 2 and 13 days, errors grew with the background baroclinic instability, and the character of the error growth mirrored the case of k23 turbulence. The existence of an error growth regime with properties similar to k25/3 turbulence confirmed the radical idea of E. N. Lorenz that the atmosphere has a finite limit of predictability, no matter how small the initial error. The global-mean predictability limit of the troposphere was estimated here to be around 2–3 weeks, which is in agreement with previous work. However, scale-dependent predictability limits differed between the divergent and rotational wind component and between vertical levels, indicating that atmospheric predictability is a more complex problem than that of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. The practical value of global cloud-resolving models is discussed in light of the various aspects of atmospheric predictability.},

The atmosphere’s fast mixing time scales were thought to inhibit the necessary memory effect for such multistability. Here we show that moisture accumulation within the atmospheric column generates hysteresis in monsoon circulation independent of oceanic heat storage and yields two stable atmospheric states for the same boundary conditions. Hysteresis is shown in observational data, reproduced in a general circulation model where it increases with decreasing oceanic memory and then reproduced in a mathematical formulation of the moisture-advection feedback. Thus moisture accumulation can generate bistability through an atmospheric memory that carries information across time scales much longer than those typical for mixing. This has implications for the future evolution of monsoon rainfall that is crucial for the agricultural productivity currently feeding more than two billion people.},

In winter, cold waves that occur during atmospheric blocking are normally observed downstream or south of these systems. Here, horizontal advection of cold air masses from higher latitudes plays a decisive role. Extreme snowfall can also occur with the lower temperatures, indicating a shift of the storm track due to the blocking system.

Could anthropogenic climate change result in worldwide societal collapse or even eventual human extinction? At present, this is a dangerously underexplored topic. Yet there are ample reasons to suspect that climate change could result in a global catastrophe. Analyzing the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanize action, improve resilience, and inform policy, including emergency responses. We outline current knowledge about the likelihood of extreme climate change, discuss why understanding bad-to-worst cases is vital, articulate reasons for concern about catastrophic outcomes, define key terms, and put forward a research agenda. The proposed agenda covers four main questions: 1) What is the potential for climate change to drive mass extinction events? 2) What are the mechanisms that could result in human mass mortality and morbidity? 3) What are human societies' vulnerabilities to climate-triggered risk cascades, such as from conflict, political instability, and systemic financial risk? 4) How can these multiple strands of evidence—together with other global dangers—be usefully synthesized into an “integrated catastrophe assessment”? It is time for the scientific community to grapple with the challenge of better understanding catastrophic climate change.},

Yet QG turbulence differs from 2D turbulence in fundamental ways, which are not generally known. Here we discuss ingredients missing in 2D turbulence formulations of large-scale atmospheric turbulence. We argue that there is no proof that energy cannot cascade downscale in QG turbulence. Indeed, observational evidence supports a downscale flux of both energy and enstrophy in the mesoscales. It is suggested that the observed atmospheric energy spectrum is explainable if there is a downscale energy cascade of QG turbulence, but is inconsistent with 2D turbulence theories, which require an upscale energy flux. A simple solved example is used to illustrate some of the ideas discussed.},

  abstract = {Quasi-geostrophic (QG) theory describes the dynamics of synoptic scale flows in the trophosphere that are balanced with respect to both acoustic and internal gravity waves. Within this framework, effects of (turbulent) friction near the ground are usually represented by Ekman Layer theory. The troposphere covers roughly the lowest ten kilometers of the atmosphere while Ekman layer heights are typically just a few hundred meters. However, this two-layer asymptotic theory does not explicitly account for substantial changes of the potential temperature stratification due to diabatic heating associated with cloud formation or with radiative and turbulent heat fluxes, which, in the middle latitudes, can be particularly important in about the lowest three kilometers. To address this deficiency, this paper extends the classical QG–Ekman layer model by introducing an intermediate, dynamically and thermodynamically active layer, called the “diabatic layer” (DL) from here on. The flow in this layer is also in acoustic, hydrostatic, and geostrophic balance but, in contrast to QG flow, variations of potential temperature are not restricted to small deviations from a stable and time independent background stratification. Instead, within the diabatic layer, diabatic processes are allowed to affect the leading-order stratification. As a consequence, the diabatic layer modifies the pressure field at the top of the Ekman layer, and with it the intensity of Ekman pumping seen by the quasi-geostrophic bulk flow. The result is the proposed extended quasi-geostrophic three-layer QG-DL-Ekman model for mid-latitude (dry and moist) dynamics.},

For scales above several kilometers and minutes, there is a natural scale separation induced by the atmosphere’s thermal stratification, together with the influences of gravity and Earth’s rotation, and the fact that atmospheric-flow Mach numbers are typically small. A central aim of theoretical meteorology is to understand the associated scale-specific flow phenomena, such as internal gravity waves, baroclinic instabilities, Rossby waves, cloud formation and moist convection, (anti-)cyclonic weather patterns, hurricanes, and a variety of interacting waves in the tropics. Single-scale asymptotics yields reduced sets of equations that capture the essence of these scale-specific processes. For studies of interactions across scales, techniques of multiple-scales asymptotics have received increasing recognition in recent years. This article recounts the most prominent scales and associated scale-dependent models and summarizes recent multiple-scales developments.},

However, few studies have investigated this link, and even less is known about individual differences in people’s responses to the weather. In the current study, we sought to identify weather reactivity types by linking self-reported daily mood across 30 days with objective weather data. We identified four distinct types among 497 adolescents and replicated these types among their mothers. The types were labeled Summer Lovers (better mood with warmer and sunnier weather), Unaffected (weak associations between weather and mood), Summer Haters (worse mood with warmer and sunnier weather), and Rain Haters (particularly bad mood on rainy days). In addition, intergenerational concordance effects were found for two of these types, suggesting that weather reactivity may run in the family. Overall, the large individual differences in how people’s moods were affected by weather reconciles the discrepancy between the generally held beliefs that weather has a substantive effect on mood and findings from previous research indicating that effects of weather on mood are limited or absent.},

GCMs are physics-based simulators that combine a numerical solver for large-scale dynamics with tuned representations for small-scale processes such as cloud formation. Recently, machine-learning models trained on reanalysis data have achieved comparable or better skill than GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting3,4. However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present a GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with machine-learning components and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best machine-learning and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with machine-learning models for one- to ten-day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for one- to fifteen-day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140-kilometre resolution show emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs, although our model does not extrapolate to substantially different future climates. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.},

We consider the two cases of a cylinder at rest and rotating around its cylinder axis. We find that the relative amplitude of the large-scale circulation (LSC) and its orientation inside the container at different points in time are associated to prominent geometric features in the embedding space spanned by the two dominant diffusion-maps eigenvectors. From this two-dimensional embedding we can measure azimuthal drift and diffusion rates, as well as coherence times of the LSC. In addition, we can distinguish from the data clearly the single roll state (SRS), when a single roll extends through the whole cell, from the double roll state (DRS), when two counter-rotating rolls are on top of each other. Based on this embedding we also build a transition matrix (a discrete transfer operator), whose eigenvectors and eigenvalues reveal typical time scales for the stability of the SRS and DRS as well as for the azimuthal drift velocity of the flow structures inside the cylinder. Thus, the combination of nonlinear dimension reduction and dynamical systems tools enables to gain insight into turbulent flows without relying on model assumptions.},

It might be subject to time-varying forcing; or be in a transient phase on its way towards equilibrium; it might even be in equilibrium without us noticing it, due to insufficient observations; and it even might be a system failing to admit an equilibrium distribution at all. We review some of the approaches that model the effective statistical behavior of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamical systems, and show that both cases can be considered under the unified framework of optimal low-rank approximation of so-called transfer operators. Particular attention is given to the connection between these methods, Markov state models, and the concept of metastability, further to the estimation of such reduced order models from finite simulation data. All these topics bear an important role in, e.g., molecular dynamics, where Markov state models are often and successfully utilized, and which is the main motivating application in this paper. We illustrate our considerations by numerical examples.},

Recently quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) was proposed as a mechanism that, when certain dynamical conditions are fulfilled, can lead to such high-amplitude wave events. Based on these resonance conditions a detection scheme to scan reanalysis data for QRA events in boreal summer months was implemented. With this objective detection scheme we analyzed the occurrence and duration of QRA events and the associated atmospheric flow patterns in 1979–2015 reanalysis data. We detect a total number of 178 events for wave 6, 7 and 8 and find that during roughly one-third of all high amplitude events QRA conditions were met for respective waves. Our analysis reveals a significant shift for quasi-stationary waves 6 and 7 towards high amplitudes during QRA events, lagging first QRA-detection by typically one week. The results provide further evidence for the validity of the QRA hypothesis and its important role in generating high amplitude waves in boreal summer.},

  abstract = {Slow-moving planetary waves of high amplitudes are often associated with persistent surface weather conditions. This persistence can lead to extreme weather events with potentially serious implications for society and nature. Quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of planetary waves has been proposed as a mechanism to generate high-amplitude hemisphere-wide patterns of wavenumbers 6–8 in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer. Here this mechanism is studied in both hemispheres. Analyzing 1979–2015 reanalysis data, evidence for QRA in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is found for wavenumbers 4 and 5. It is shown that the difference in resonating wavenumbers between hemispheres stems from the different magnitude and latitudinal shape of the respective zonal-mean zonal winds. During resonance events a strong and narrow jet is observed in both hemispheres, whereas the emergence of a second zonal mean jet at high latitudes (i.e., a ‘‘double jet’’) is seen in the NH only. Strong and narrow jets can form stable, zonally oriented waveguides, which are an essential prerequisite for resonance. After investigating the waves’ preferred phase positions during QRA, a bimodal behavior is identified for wavenumbers 4 and 5 in the SH and for wavenumber 6 in the NH, whereas wavenumbers 7 and 8 exhibit a single preferred phase position in the NH. Composite plots of meridional wind and temperature anomalies during periods when the resonating wave is in the preferred phase position indicate those regions that are most likely to experience heat extremes. These regions include western North America, western Europe, and central Eurasia in the NH and Patagonia and Australia in the SH.},

The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation9,10 has been implicated in modulations of global mean surface temperatures6,11, but which part of the mode drives the variability in warming rates is unclear. Here we present a successful simulation of the global warming staircase since 1900 with a global ocean–atmosphere coupled model where tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures are forced to follow the observed evolution. Without prescribed tropical Pacific variability, the same model, on average, produces a continual warming trend that accelerates after the 1960s. We identify four events where the tropical Pacific decadal cooling markedly slowed down the warming trend. Matching the observed spatial and seasonal fingerprints we identify the tropical Pacific as a key pacemaker of the warming staircase, with radiative forcing driving the overall warming trend. Specifically, tropical Pacific variability amplifies the first warming epoch of the 1910s–1940s and determines the timing when the big hiatus starts and ends. Our method of removing internal variability from the observed record can be used for real-time monitoring of anthropogenic warming.},

Here we use recent empirical findings from more than 1,600 regions worldwide over the past 40\,years to project sub-national damages from temperature and precipitation, including daily variability and extremes               7,8               . Using an empirical approach that provides a robust lower bound on the persistence of impacts on economic growth, we find that the world economy is committed to an income reduction of 19\% within the next 26\,years independent of future emission choices~(relative to a baseline without climate impacts, likely range of 11–29\% accounting for physical climate and empirical uncertainty). These damages already outweigh the mitigation costs required to limit global warming to 2\,°C by sixfold over this near-term time frame and thereafter diverge strongly dependent on emission choices. Committed damages arise predominantly through changes in average temperature, but accounting for further climatic components raises estimates by approximately 50\% and leads to stronger regional heterogeneity. Committed losses are projected for all regions except those at very high latitudes, at which reductions in temperature variability bring benefits. The largest losses are committed at lower latitudes in regions with lower cumulative historical emissions and lower present-day income.},

On the basis of a global dataset of 45\,pairs of events that occurred within the same area, we show that risk management generally reduces the impacts of floods and droughts but faces difficulties in reducing the impacts of unprecedented events of a magnitude not previously experienced. If the second event was much more hazardous than the first, its impact was almost always higher. This is because management was not designed to deal with such extreme events: for example, they exceeded the design levels of levees and reservoirs. In two success stories, the impact of the second, more hazardous, event was lower, as a result of improved risk management governance and high investment in integrated management. The observed difficulty of managing unprecedented events is alarming, given that more extreme hydrological events are projected owing to climate change               3               .},

  abstract = {Gigatonne scale geological storage of carbon dioxide and energy (such as hydrogen) will be central aspects of a sustainable energy future, both for mitigating CO2 emissions and providing seasonal-based green energy provisions. In this Review, we evaluate the feasibility and challenges of expanding subsurface carbon dioxide storage into a global-scale business, and explore how this experience can be exploited to accelerate the development of underground hydrogen storage. Carbon storage is technically and commercially successful at the megatonne scale, with current projects mitigating approximately 30 Mt of CO2 per year. However, limiting anthropogenic warming to 1.5°C could require gigatonnes of storage per year by 2050, and a scaleup from 2025 approaching rates of deployment that would be historic for energy technology. Scale-up is not limited by geology or engineering. Advances in understandingstorage complex geology, subsurface fluid dynamics, and seismic risk underpin new engineering strategies including the development of multi-site, basin scale, storage resource management. Instead economic and societal contraints pose barriers to project development. Underground hydrogen storage, still in development, will face similar issues. Overcoming these barriers with strengthened financial incentives, and programs to address concerns inhibiting public acceptance, will enable the storage of CO2 at climate relevant scales.},

The problems ahead for long‐range predictability extending into the climate time scale are also presented. The sensitive dependence of chaos on initial conditions and the imperfections in the models limit reliable predictability of the instantaneous state of the weather to less than 10 days in present‐day operational forecasts. The existence of slowly varying components such as the sea surface temperature, soil moisture, snow cover, and sea ice may provide basis for predicting certain aspects of climate at long range. The regularly varying nonlinear oscillations, such as the Madden‐Julian Oscillation, monsoon intraseasonal oscillations, and El Niño‐Southern Oscillation, are also possible sources of extended‐range predictability at the climate time scale. A prediction model based on phase space reconstruction has demonstrated that monsoon intraseasonal oscillation can be better predicted at long leads.},

Atmospheric regimes are identified as persistent or metastable states using a hidden Markov model analysis. A somewhat counterintuitive, coherence resonance-like effect is observed: regime predictability increases with increasing noise level up to an intermediate optimal value, before decreasing when further increasing the noise level. The enhanced regime predictability is due to increased persistence of the regimes. The effect is found in the Lorenz '63 model and a low-order model of barotropic flow over topography. The increased predictability is only present in the regime dynamics, that is, in a coarse-grained view of the system; predictability of individual trajectories decreases monotonically with increasing noise level. A possible explanation for the phenomenon is given and implications of the finding for weather and climate modelling and prediction are discussed.},

RCB estimates for 1.5\,°C are small, and minor changes in their calculation can therefore result in large relative adjustments. Here we evaluate recent RCB assessments by the IPCC and present more recent data, calculation refinements and robustness checks that increase confidence in them. We conclude that the RCB for a 50\% chance of keeping warming to 1.5\,°C is around 250\,GtCO               2               as of January 2023, equal to around six years of current CO               2               emissions.

Here, we use a year‐round North American regime classification to identify summertime circulation trends from 1981 to 2024. We find large increases in the frequency, persistence and interannual variability of the Greenland High (GH) regime, similar to Greenland blocking. A simple Markov model shows that the observed increased GH frequency and variability can arise from increased persistence. We then show that a 10,000member ensemble using SEAS5 seasonal model data fails to capture the observed trend in GH frequency because persistence trends are too weak. This occurs despite SEAS5 producing summers with more GH days and individual regimes more persistent than observed, so the issue is not simply an overall lack of persistence. Hence, the missing trends must arise from fundamental model deficiencies which develop on subseasonal timescales and are not rectified by initialization.},

  abstract = {The debate on the sign of the soil moisture–precipitation feedback remains open. On the one hand, studies using global coarse-resolution climate models have found strong positive feedback. However, such models cannot represent convection explicitly. On the other hand, studies using km-scale regional climate models and explicit convection have reported negative feedback. Yet, the large-scale circulation is prescribed in such models. This study revisits the soil moisture–precipitation feedback using global, coupled simulations conducted for 1 y with explicit convection and compares the results to coarse-resolution simulations with parameterized convection. We find significant differences in a majority of points with feedback that is weaker and dominantly negative with explicit convection. The model with explicit convection is more often in a wet regime and prefers the triggering of convection over dry soil in the presence of soil moisture heterogeneity, in contrast to the coarse-resolution model. Further analysis indicates that the feedback not only between soil moisture and evapotranspiration but also between evapotranspiration and precipitation is weaker, in better agreement with observations. Our findings suggest that coarse-resolution models may not be well suited to study aspects of climate change over land such as changes in droughts and heatwaves.},

The inclusion of stochastic schemes to represent model uncertainties has improved the probabilistic skill of the ECMWF ensemble by increasing reliability and reducing the error of the ensemble mean. Recent progress, challenges and future directions regarding stochastic representations of model uncertainties at ECMWF are described in this article. The coming years are likely to see a further increase in the use of ensemble methods in forecasts and assimilation. This will put increasing demands on the methods used to perturb the forecast model. An area that is receiving greater attention than 5–10 years ago is the physical consistency of the perturbations. Other areas where future efforts will be directed are the expansion of uncertainty representations to the dynamical core and other components of the Earth system, as well as the overall computational efficiency of representing model uncertainty.},

  abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of mesoscale atmospheric predictability to the slope of the background kinetic energy spectrum E by adding initial errors to simulations of idealized moist midlatitude cyclones at several wavenumbers k for which the slope of E(k) is significantly different. These different slopes arise from 1) differences in the E(k) generated by cyclones growing in two different moist baroclinically unstable environments, and 2) differences in the horizontal scale at which initial perturbations are added, with E(k) having steeper slopes at larger scales. When small-amplitude potential temperature perturbations are added, the error growth through the subsequent 36-h simulation is not sensitive to the slope of E(k) nor to the horizontal scale of the initial error. In all cases with small-amplitude perturbations, the error growth in physical space is dominated by moist convection along frontal boundaries. As such, the error field is localized in physical space and broad in wavenumber (spectral) space. In moist midlatitude cyclones, these broadly distributed errors in wavenumber space limit mesoscale predictability by growing up-amplitude rather than by cascading upscale to progressively longer wavelengths. In contrast, the error distribution in homogeneous turbulence is broad in physical space and localized in wavenumber space, and dimensional analysis can be used to estimate the error growth rate at a specific wavenumber k from E(k). Predictability estimates derived in this manner, and from the numerical solutions of idealized models of homogeneous turbulence, depend on whether the slope of E(k) is shallower or steeper than k23, which differs from the slopeinsensitive behavior exhibited by moist midlatitude cyclones.},

  abstract = {The Stochastically Perturbed Parametrization Tendencies (SPPT) scheme is used in ensemble forecast systems to represent uncertainties due to the atmospheric physics parametrizations. The scheme works by introducing random perturbations to the tendencies from the physics schemes. The size of the perturbations is modulated by the size of the net tendencies from the full physics suite. Recent work has identified an inconsistency in this approach to attributing model uncertainty: greater uncertainty is attributed to the night-time sky than to the daytime sky in clear-sky conditions, which is not deemed physically realistic. This paper documents the details of a revised configuration of SPPT, which became active in the recent operational version of the ensemble forecast system (“CY45R1”) at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) — released in June 2018. In this work, a modification to SPPT is outlined such that the clear-sky contribution from the radiation scheme is subtracted from the physics tendencies that are acted on by SPPT. Inspection of individual vertical profiles of physics tendencies provides a greater understanding of the interactions between processes, and helps demonstrate that the revision gives a more realistic description of the associated uncertainties. Forecast experiments with the revised version of SPPT demonstrate neutral to positive impacts on the skill of the ensemble forecasts in the medium-range; and in the extended-range, a significantly improved match between the spread and error of the principal components describing the Madden–Julian Oscillation. In addition, it is shown that including the revisions in the ensemble of data assimilations leads to increases in spread in the boundary layer.},

  abstract = {We use a simple yet Earth-like hemispheric atmospheric model to propose a new framework for the mathematical properties of blocking events. Using finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we show that the occurrence of blockings is associated with conditions featuring anomalously high instability. Longer-lived blockings are very rare and have typically higher instability. In the case of Atlantic blockings, predictability is especially reduced at the onset and decay of the blocking event, while a relative increase of predictability is found in the mature phase. The opposite holds for Pacific blockings, for which predictability is lowest in the mature phase. Blockings are realised when the trajectory of the system is in the neighbourhood of a specific class of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs), natural modes of variability that cover the attractor the system. UPOs corresponding to blockings have, indeed, a higher degree of instability compared to UPOs associated with zonal flow. Our results provide a rigorous justification for the classical Markov chains-based analysis of transitions between weather regimes. The analysis of UPOs elucidates that the model features a very severe violation of hyperbolicity, due to the presence of a substantial variability in the number of unstable dimensions, which explains why atmospheric states can differ a lot in term of their predictability. Additionally, such a variability explains the need for performing data assimilation in a state space that includes not only the unstable and neutral subspaces, but also some stable modes. The lack of robustness associated with the violation of hyperbolicity might be a basic cause contributing to the difficulty in representing blockings in numerical models and in predicting how their statistics will change as a result of climate change. This corresponds to fundamental issues limiting our ability to construct very accurate numerical models of the atmosphere, in term of predictability of the both the first and of the second kind in the sense of Lorenz.},

  abstract = {Models are continuously developed at numerical weather prediction (NWP) centres to improve forecast skill, with new operational model configurations adopted every few years. The parametrizations of diabatic processes are probably the most frequently updated part of NWP models as they are crucial for accurate weather predictions and contain uncertainties in their formulation. The impact of model developments is assessed here in forecasts from the Met Office's weather forecast model initialised throughout the North Atlantic Waveguide and Downstream Impact Experiment field campaign period in autumn 2016. Planned model parametrization developments are considered, together with an ‘inexpensive coupled’ forecast with daily updating of the sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction. Forecasts produced from the coupled system have, on average, indistinguishable skill from the control forecasts, suggesting the benefits of coupled atmosphere–ocean NWP systems can be small. In contrast, a reduction in forecast error (∼4\%) is identified in forecasts produced using an upgraded convection scheme. Periods of low forecast skill during the study period are shown to be associated with the onset and decay of blocking events and increased diabatic heating of air masses reaching the upper troposphere. In forecasts of a specific block development case that was not accurately predicted in any of the experiments or in the operational ensemble forecast from the Met Office, the representation of diabatic heating in the warm conveyor belt of an upstream cyclone is shown to moderate the subsequent block development; forecasts in which the heating is stronger generally have a more-amplified blocking ridge and amplified heating contributions from all parametrizations as diagnosed using diabatic tracers. Hence, we demonstrate that plausible changes to the representation of several different diabatic processes in models can impact forecast block development via changes within upstream cyclones.},

  abstract = {A feature‐based approach is introduced to assess the quality of the representation of warm conveyor belts (WCBs) in high‐resolution forecasts of the European Centre for Medium‐range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). WCBs are moist ascending airstreams in extratropical cyclones, which transport boundary‐layer air within 1–2 days poleward to the upper troposphere. The WCB outflow is typically characterised by low potential vorticity (PV), amplifying upper‐level ridges and in turn modifying the jet stream and downstream Rossby wave evolution. Therefore the correct representation of WCBs can be essential for medium‐range weather prediction. A three‐component verification measure PAL is introduced, measuring errors in the WCB outflow's PV anomaly (               P               component), the amplitude of the WCB (               A               component), and the location of the outflow (               L               component). The PAL approach is applied to North Atlantic WCBs in ECMWF forecasts during three winters between 2002/2003 and 2010/2011. For the latest winter, the PAL results are also compared to the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) of upper‐level PV. It is shown that (i) the representation of WCBs improves for forecasts with a shorter lead time, (ii) PAL values are on average better for more recent forecasts, (iii) recent model versions show no systematic over‐ or underestimation of WCB intensity, (iv) individual medium‐range forecasts can be associated with large errors in particular in the amplitude of WCBs, and (v) the comparison of PAL and the ACC indicates that several poor forecasts in terms of ACC are indeed associated with significant errors in the representation of WCBs. Limitations of this study are also discussed.},

  abstract = {A global climatology of warm conveyor belts (WCBs) is presented for the years 1979–2010, based on trajectories calculated with Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data. WCB trajectories are identified as strongly ascending air parcels (600 hPa in 2 days) near extratropical cyclones. Corroborating earlier studies, WCBs are more frequent during winter than summer and they ascend preferentially in the western ocean basins between 258 and 508 latitude. Before ascending, WCB trajectories typically approach from the subtropics in summer and from more midlatitude regions in winter. Considering humidity, cloud water, and potential temperature along WCBs confirms that they experience strong condensation and integrated latent heating during the ascent (typically .20 K). Liquid and ice water contents along WCBs peak at about 700 and 550 hPa, respectively. The mean potential vorticity (PV) evolution shows typical tropospheric values near 900 hPa, followed by an increase to almost 1 potential vorticity unit (PVU) at 700 hPa, and a decrease to less than 0.5 PVU at 300 hPa. These low PV values in the upper troposphere constitute significant negative anomalies with amplitudes of 1–3 PVU, which can strongly influence the downstream flow. Considering the low-level diabatic PV production, (i) WCBs starting at low latitudes (,408) are unlikely to attain high PV (due to weak planetary vorticity) although they exhibit the strongest latent heating, and (ii) for those ascending at higher latitudes, a strong vertical heating gradient and high absolute vorticity are both important. This study therefore provides climatological insight into the cloud diabatic formation of significant positive and negative PV anomalies in the extratropical lower and upper troposphere, respectively.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In this review, we highlight the complementary relationship between simple and comprehensive models in addressing key scientific questions to describe Earth's atmospheric circulation. The systematic representation of models in steps, or hierarchies, connects our understanding from idealized systems to comprehensive models and ultimately the observed atmosphere. We define three interconnected principles that can be used to characterize the model hierarchies of the atmosphere. We explore the rich diversity within the governing equations in the               dynamical hierarchy               , the ability to isolate and understand atmospheric processes in the               process hierarchy               , and the importance of the physical domain and resolution in the               hierarchy of scale               . We center our discussion on the large‐scale circulation of the atmosphere and its interaction with clouds and convection, focusing on areas where simple models have had a significant impact. Our confidence in climate model projections of the future is based on our efforts to ground the climate predictions in fundamental physical understanding. This understanding is, in part, possible due to the hierarchies of idealized models that afford the simplicity required for understanding complex systems.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             Model hierarchies are fundamental to our understanding of the large‐scale circulation of Earth's atmosphere. They have played a critical role in forming and testing our ability to simulate and predict the natural variability of the atmosphere, such as the variations of the extratropical jet streams, and for exploring how the climate will respond to external forcing, such as increased carbon dioxide. In this review we discuss simple models that form the basis of our understanding of the atmosphere and how they connect to the comprehensive models used for climate prediction through the model hierarchies. We describe three principles that help organize the model hierarchies and discuss benchmark models that have been influential in understanding the large‐scale circulation in the midlatitudes, middle atmosphere, and tropics.           ,              Key Points                                                                Model hierarchies help address open research questions; we focus on how they have improved our understanding of atmospheric circulation                                                     Model hierarchies are commonly referred to but remain poorly defined; we identify three principles to organize models into hierarchies                                                     Key benchmark models of the atmospheric circulation are identified and connected to comprehensive models through model hierarchies},

  abstract = {Abstract             While previous research on sub-seasonal tropical cyclone (TC) occurrence has mostly focused on either the validation of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, or the development of statistical models trained on past data, the present study combines both approaches to a statistical–dynamical model for probabilistic forecasts in the North Atlantic basin. Although state-of-the-art NWP models have been shown to lack predictive skill with respect to sub-seasonal weekly TC occurrence, they may predict the environmental conditions sufficiently well to generate predictors for a statistical model. Therefore, an extensive predictor set was generated, including predictor groups representing the climatological seasonal cycle (CSC), oceanic, and tropical conditions, tropical wave modes, as well as extratropical influences, respectively. The developed hybrid forecast model is systematically validated for the Gulf of Mexico and Central Main Development Region (MDR) for lead times up to five weeks. Moreover, its performance is compared against a statistical approach trained on past data, as well as against different climatological and NWP benchmarks. For sub-seasonal lead times, the CSC models are found to outperform the NWP models, which quickly loose skill within the first two forecast weeks, even in case of recalibration. The statistical models trained on past data increase skill over the CSC models, whereas even greater improvements in skill are gained by the hybrid approach out to week five. The vast majority of the additional sub-seasonal skill in the hybrid model, relative to the CSC model, could be attributed to the tropical (oceanic) conditions in the Gulf of Mexico (Central MDR).},

We consider here the Lorenz 1963 model with the classic parameters’ value. We investigate how a chaotic trajectory can be approximated using a complete set of UPOs up to symbolic dynamics’ period 14. At each instant, we rank the UPOs according to their proximity to the position of the orbit in the phase space. We study this process from two different perspectives. First, we find that longer period UPOs overwhelmingly provide the best local approximation to the trajectory. Second, we construct a finite-state Markov chain by studying the scattering of the orbit between the neighborhood of the various UPOs. Each UPO and its neighborhood are taken as a possible state of the system. Through the analysis of the subdominant eigenvectors of the corresponding stochastic matrix, we provide a different interpretation of the mixing processes occurring in the system by taking advantage of the concept of quasi-invariant sets.},

One of the topics discussed is the stochastic modelling of mid-latitude low-frequency variability through a few teleconnection patterns, including the central role and physical mechanisms responsible for multiplicative noise. A new low-dimensional stochastic model is developed here, which mimics key features of atmospheric general circulation models, to test the fidelity of stochastic mode reduction procedures. The second topic discussed here is the systematic design of stochastic lattice models to capture irregular and highly intermittent features that are not resolved by a deterministic parametrization. A recent applied mathematics design principle for stochastic column modelling with intermittency is illustrated in an idealized setting for deep tropical convection; the practical effect of this stochastic model in both slowing down convectively coupled waves and increasing their fluctuations is presented here.},

These quantities are based on the integration, for a finite time, along trajectories of an intrinsic bounded, positive geometrical and/or physical property of the trajectory itself. We discuss a general methodology for constructing Lagrangian descriptors, and we discuss a ‘‘heuristic argument’’ that explains why this method is successful for revealing geometrical structures in the phase space of a dynamical system. We support this argument by explicit calculations on a benchmark problem having a hyperbolic fixed point with stable and unstable manifolds that are known analytically. Several other benchmark examples are considered that allow us the assess the performance of Lagrangian descriptors in revealing invariant tori and regions of shear. Throughout the paper ‘‘side-by-side’’ comparisons of the performance of Lagrangian descriptors with both finite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) and finite time averages of certain components of the vector field (‘‘time averages’’) are carried out and discussed. In all cases Lagrangian descriptors are shown to be both more accurate and computationally efficient than these methods. We also perform computations for an explicitly three dimensional, aperiodically time-dependent vector field and an aperiodically time dependent vector field defined as a data set. Comparisons with FTLEs and time averages for these examples are also carried out, with similar conclusions as for the benchmark examples.},

  abstract = {Low-order climate models can play an important role in understanding low-frequency variability in the atmospheric circulation and how forcing consistent with anthropogenic climate change may affect this variability. Here, we study a conceptual model of the mid-latitudes’ atmospheric circulation from the perspective of nonautonomous dynamical systems. First, a bifurcation analysis is carried out under timeindependent forcing in order to identify different types of behavior in the autonomous model’s parameter space. Next, we focus on the study of the nonautonomous system in which the cross-latitudinal heat flux varies seasonally, according to insolation changes. The forward attractor of the seasonally forced model is compared with the attractor of the autonomous one. The seasonal forcing results in a clear change of the attractor’s shape. The summer attractor loses its periodicity, and, hence, predictability, when the forcing is seasonal, while the winter attractor favors energy transport through one of the model’s two wave components. Climate change forcing produces several remarkable effects. Thus, the analysis of the model’s forward attractor under climate trends suggests that the jet speed does not always follow the sign of the change in equator-to-pole thermal contrast, while the change in the energy transported by the eddies does. Chaotic behavior can be completely suppressed in favor of a regular periodic one and vice versa. Circulation patterns can change, suddenly disappear, and rebuild. The model’s forward attractor in the presence of time-dependent forcing proves to be a robust tool to study model changes in internal variability due to climate trends, both positive and negative.},

  abstract = {A strategy for diagnosing and interpreting flow regimes that is firmly rooted in dynamical theory is presented and applied to the study of observed and modeled planetary-scale regimes of the wintertime circulation in the Northern Hemisphere. The method assumes a nonlinear dynamical model of the atmospheric motion, and determines a subspace of the phase space of the model in which multiple quasi-stationary solutions of the equations of motion are likely to be located. The axes that generate this subspace are the vectors that possess the smallest amplitude of the time derivative computed from a linearized version of the model, using the time-mean state of the system as a basic state. These vectors are called here “neutral vectors,” and are shown to be eigenvectors of a self-adjoint operator derived from the linearized model. As a prototype of a dynamical system with quadratic nonlinearity relevant to atmospheric dynamics, the three-variable convection model that generates the well-known Lorenz attractor is first investigated. It is shown that the presence of two unstable stationary solutions, which determine the shape of the attractor, generates a strong bimodality in the projection of the state vector of the system onto the most neutral vector, once a proper time filter is used on the data. To apply this method to the analysis of atmospheric low-frequency variability, a three-level quasigeostrophic model in spherical geometry is adopted as the dynamical model. Neutral vectors are computed using the observed mean atmospheric state in winter as a basic state; alternative basic states, in which the eddies in the time-mean state are partially or fully removed, are also used in sensitivity experiments. The spatial patterns of the leading neutral vectors are relative insensitive to variations in some model parameters, but are strongly controlled by the form of the basic state; such dependence can be understood in terms of linear planetary-wave theory. The neutral vectors of the wintertime climatology are then used to analyse a 32-winter sample of observed atmospheric fields. It is found that the time series of the projection of these fields onto one particular neutral vector has a significantly bimodal probability density function, suggesting the existence of (at least) two separate flow regimes associated with anomalies of opposite sign. The two regimes are hemispheric in extent, and are close to some of the clusters found in previous studies that made use of empirical orthogonal functions. Finally, it is shown that, if an appropriate forcing function is employed, the quasigeostrophic model is able to generate a very realistic climatology in a long nonlinear integration and, furthermore, two regimes similar to the observed ones. Again, these regimes can be identified by the presence of bimodality in the probability density function of the projections of model fields onto neutral vectors. Modeled and observed regimes have not only similar spatial patterns but also an almost identical distribution of the residence time.},

The ozone reductions have been primarily attributed to a strengthening Brewer-Dobson circulation, which upwells ozone-poor air. Yet, this paper finds that strengthening upwelling only explains part of the reduction. The reduction is also driven by tropospheric expansion under global warming, which erodes the ozone layer from below, the low ozone anomalies from which are advected upwards. Strengthening upwelling and tropospheric expansion are correlated under global warming, making it challenging to disentangle their relative contributions. Therefore, chemistry-climate model output is used to validate an idealized model of ozone photochemistry and transport with a tropopause lower boundary condition. In our idealized decomposition, strengthening upwelling and tropospheric expansion both contribute at leading order to reducing tropical ozone. Tropospheric expansion drives bottom-heavy reductions in ozone, which decay in magnitude into the mid-stratosphere.},

Artificially suppressing surface latent heat flux over the Gulf Stream (GS) region reduces atmospheric blocking frequency across the Northern Hemisphere by up to 30\%. Affected blocks show a shorter lifespan ( 6\%), smaller spatial extent ( 10\%), and reduced intensity ( 0.4\%), with an increased number of individual blocking anticyclones (+17\%). These findings are robust across various blocking detection thresholds. Analysis reveals a qualitatively consistent response across all resolutions, with Tco639 (∼18 km) showing the largest statistically significant change across all blocking characteristics, although differences between resolutions are not statistically significant. Exploring the broader Rossby wave pattern, we observe that diminished moisture fluxes favor eastward propagation and higher zonal wavenumbers, while air‐sea interactions promote stationary and westward‐propagating waves with zonal wavenumber 3. This study underscores the critical role of the GS in modulating atmospheric blocking.},

  abstract = {The connection between atmospheric blocking over the North Atlantic and the diabatic influence of the Gulf Stream is investigated using potential vorticity and moist potential vorticity diagnostics in the ERA5 reanalysis data set during wintertime (1979 - 2020). In line with previous research, the reliance atmospheric blocking has on turbulent heat fluxes over the Gulf Stream and its extension, for induction and maintenance, is shown to be significant. The air-sea heat flux generates negative potential vorticity air masses in the atmospheric boundary layer. These air masses subsequently contribute to the block’s negative potential vorticity anomaly at upper levels through ascending motion in the warm conveyor belt. It is shown that the block’s size and frequency partially depends on oceanic preconditioning via anomalous oceanic heat transport and heat content, prior to the blocking event, both of which allow for stronger turbulent heat fluxes. It is further hypothesized that the block feeds back positively on itself through the advection of cold dry air over the Gulf Stream, sustaining this air-sea interaction. This in turn decreases ocean heat content, eventually halting this air-sea interaction and severing the atmospheric block from its maintenance pathway.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Considering a whole summer season in central Europe, we find that the operational, convection‐permitting ICON‐D2 ensemble prediction system is spatially underdispersive in convective precipitation forecasts. The spatial spread of hourly precipitation is insufficient to capture the inherent error adequately across all scales (up to 300\,km) and forecast times (up to 24\,h). This lack of spread becomes more pronounced in the weak convective forcing regime. Using physically based stochastic perturbations in the planetary boundary layer is beneficial and leads to a reduction in spatial error at scales larger than 20\,km and increases the spread at scales less than 50\,km during weak forcing of convection, whereas the effect is almost neutral during strong forcing. Complementing the stochastic perturbations by perturbed parameters in the microphysics scheme shows an additive effect on spatial error and spread for a characteristic case study. Assessing the practical predictability of convective precipitation in a flow‐dependent manner is crucial, and our approach of combining multiple sources of uncertainty proves beneficial in mitigating the spatial underdispersion across scales, particularly during weak convective forcing.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This study investigates mixed-phase cloud (MPC) processes along the warm conveyor belts (WCBs) of two extratropical cyclones observed during the North Atlantic Waveguide and Downstream Impact Experiment (NAWDEX). The aim is to investigate the effect of two radically distinct parameterizations for MPCs on the WCB and the ridge building downstream: the first one (REF) drastically limits the formation of liquid clouds, while the second one (T40) forces the liquid clouds to exist. REF exhibits a stronger heating below 6-km height and a more important cooling above 6-km height than T40. The stronger heating at lower levels is due to more important water vapor depositional processes while the larger cooling at upper levels is due to differences in radiative cooling. The consequence is a more efficient potential vorticity destruction in the WCB outflow region and a more rapid ridge building in REF than T40. A comparison with airborne remote sensing measurements is performed. REF does not form any MPCs whereas T40 does, in particular in regions detected by the radar–lidar platform like below the dry intrusion. Comparison of both ice water content and reflectivity shows there may be too much pristine ice and not enough snow in REF and not enough cold hydrometeors in general in T40. The lower ice-to-snow ratio in T40 likely explains its better distribution of hydrometeors with respect to height compared to REF. These results underline the influence of MPC processes on the upper-tropospheric circulation and the need for more MPC observations in midlatitudes.                            Significance Statement               The diabatic processes occurring in the warm conveyor belt (WCB) of extratropical cyclones impact the jet stream structure at midlatitudes. This study highlights some sensitivity of upper-level dynamics to mixed-phase-cloud-related processes. Comparisons of two different microphysical schemes for mixed-phase clouds shows that the ratio of liquid to solid clouds along the WCB ascents impacts the latent heat release and the radiation. Data from the NAWDEX campaign helps to determine room for improvement for both schemes and point out the need of a better understanding of these processes for an improved prediction of upper-level dynamics.},

The aim is to investigate the effect of two different microphysics schemes, the one-moment scheme ICE3 and the quasi two-moment scheme LIMA, on the WCB and the ridge building downstream. ICE3 and LIMA also differ in the processes of vapor deposition on hydrometeors in cold and mixed-phase clouds. Latent heating in ICE3 is found to be dominated by deposition on ice while the heating in LIMA is distributed among depositions on ice, snow, and graupel. ICE3 is the scheme leading to the largest number of WCB trajectories (30\% more than LIMA) due to greater heating rates over larger areas. The consequence is that the size of the upper-level ridge grows more rapidly in ICE3 than LIMA, albeit with some exceptions in localized regions of the cyclonic branch of the WCB. A comparison with various observations (airborne remote sensing measurements, dropsondes, and satellite data) is then performed. Below the melting layer, the observed reflectivity is rather well reproduced by the model. Above the melting layer, in the middle of the troposphere, the reflectivity and retrieved ice water content are largely underestimated by both schemes while at upper levels, the ICE3 scheme performs much better than LIMA in agreement with a closer representation of the observed winds by ICE3. These results underline the strong sensitivity of upper-level dynamics to ice-related processes.},

Changes in precipitation climatology are typically based on independent analysis of precipitation frequency and intensity. Here we show that where it rains more often, it also rains harder. When grouping global precipitation reanalysis data and observations from the past 40 years into regions of similar wet-day frequency, regardless of geographical separation, there is a strong correlation with wet-day intensity distributions. These wet-day-frequency regions are also more physically coherent than regions based on geographical location. We find the coherent relationship between wet-day frequency and intensity distributions is partially explained by wet-day-frequency regions having similar vertical velocity and convective available potential energy distributions, once polar regions are excluded. These represent dynamic and thermodynamic processes that indicate how conducive wet-day-frequency regions are to large-scale and convective precipitation. This suggests that the main drivers of precipitation are universal. We also show that extreme-precipitation metrics are dependent on wet-day frequency within our framework. Our results imply that wet-day frequency could be used to derive estimates of extreme-precipitation climate indices and corresponding uncertainties, these uncertainties being related to local processes.},

  abstract = {Weather and climate variations on subseasonal to decadal time scales can have enormous social, economic, and environmental impacts, making skillful predictions on these time scales a valuable tool for decision-makers. As such, there is a growing interest in the scientific, operational, and applications communities in developing forecasts to improve our foreknowledge of extreme events. On subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scales, these include high-impact meteorological events such as tropical cyclones, extratropical storms, floods, droughts, and heat and cold waves. On seasonal to decadal (S2D) time scales, while the focus broadly remains similar (e.g., on precipitation, surface and upper-ocean temperatures, and their effects on the probabilities of high-impact meteorological events), understanding the roles of internal variability and externally forced variability such as anthropogenic warming in forecasts also becomes important. The S2S and S2D communities share common scientific and technical challenges. These include forecast initialization and ensemble generation; initialization shock and drift; understanding the onset of model systematic errors; bias correction, calibration, and forecast quality assessment; model resolution; atmosphere–ocean coupling; sources and expectations for predictability; and linking research, operational forecasting, and end-user needs. In September 2018 a coordinated pair of international conferences, framed by the above challenges, was organized jointly by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the World Weather Research Programme (WWRP). These conferences surveyed the state of S2S and S2D prediction, ongoing research, and future needs, providing an ideal basis for synthesizing current and emerging developments in these areas that promise to enhance future operational services. This article provides such a synthesis.},

  abstract = {Blocking over Greenland is known to lead to strong surface impacts, such as ice sheet melting, and a change in its future frequency can have important consequences. However, as previous studies demonstrated, climate models underestimate the blocking frequency for the historical period. Even though some improvements have recently been made, the reasons for the model biases are still unclear. This study investigates whether models with realistic Greenland blocking frequency in winter have a correct representation of its dynamical drivers, most importantly, cyclonic wave breaking (CWB). Because blocking is a rare event and its representation is model-dependent, we use a multi-model large ensemble. We focus on two models that show typical Greenland blocking features, namely a ridge over Greenland and an equatorward-shifted jet over the North Atlantic. ECHAM6.3-LR has the best representation of CWB of the models investigated but only the second best representation of Greenland blocking frequency, which is underestimated by a factor of 2. While MIROC5 has the most realistic Greenland blocking frequency, it also has the largest (negative) CWB frequency bias, suggesting that another mechanism leads to blocking in this model. Composites over Greenland blocking days show that the present and future experiments of each model are very similar to each other in both amplitude and pattern and that there is no significant change in Greenland blocking frequency in the future. However, these projected changes in blocking frequency are highly uncertain as long as the mechanisms leading to blocking formation and maintenance in models remain poorly understood.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric blocking is a prolific producer of extreme weather with significant socioeconomic impacts. Different physical mechanisms for blocking onset have been proposed and are generally focused on two sectors: the Eurasian and the North Pacific. Here, we objectively separate blocking into four regions and investigate how the blocking onset mechanisms vary from one region to another, focusing on three factors: scale interactions between three frequency bands, Rossby wave breaking (RWB), and diabatic heating. Atlantic blocks are dominated by the low-frequency flow evolution that resembles the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation and are influenced by cyclonic RWB toward the western edge of the anticyclone. Europe blocks are influenced by high-frequency, traveling waves across the Atlantic Ocean and develop rapidly, mainly attributed to strong anticyclonic RWB and interaction between high- and intermediate-frequency flow components. Asian blocks are fixated within a stationary wave train that spans upstream to the western Atlantic Ocean and do not have strong potential vorticity or RWB features. The Pacific blocks are mainly influenced by an intermediate-frequency retrograding wave train, while a low-frequency component resembling the Pacific–North American pattern is evident. The Pacific blocks also contain precursor signals in the stratosphere. Backward trajectory analysis revealed that 35\%–45\% of parcels initialized within the Atlantic, Europe, and Pacific blocking anticyclones experience heating and ascent, while adiabatic processes dominate Asian blocking. Overall, our analysis demonstrates the importance of decomposing the flow into three frequency bands and illustrates different blocking onset mechanisms over four sectors.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Cut-off Lows are slow-moving mid-latitude storms that are detached from the main westerly flow and are often harbingers of heavy and persistent rainfall. The assessment of Cut-off Lows in climate models is relatively limited, in fact, there are no studies conducted on the future changes of Cut-off Lows within climate models. Given the importance of Cut-off Lows in leading to severe hazards, here we study them in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6’s worst-case future simulations (SSP5-8.5). Most (80\%) of the models show that Cut-off Lows with high intensity and longer lifetimes are projected to become more frequent in spring over the land regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Such an increase in Cut-off Low frequency could substantially increase related potential hazards. An increase in Cut-off Low propagation velocity, however, may partly offset this increase in hazard. Lastly, projected changes in the jet stream with possible dynamical linkages to Cut-off Lows corroborate the findings of this study.},

  abstract = {Reliable forecasts of quasi-stationary, recurrent, and persistent large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns—so-called weather regimes—are crucial for various socio-economic sectors, including energy, health, and agriculture. Despite steady progress, probabilistic weather regime predictions still exhibit biases in the exact timing and amplitude of weather regimes. This study thus aims at advancing probabilistic weather regime predictions in the North Atlantic–European region through ensemble post-processing. Here, we focus on the representation of seven year-round weather regimes in sub-seasonal to seasonal reforecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The manifestation of each of the seven regimes can be expressed by a continuous weather regime index, representing the projection of the instantaneous 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies (Z500A) onto the respective mean regime pattern. We apply a two-step ensemble post-processing involving first univariate ensemble model output statistics and second ensemble copula coupling, which restores the multivariate dependence structure. Compared with current forecast calibration practices, which rely on correcting the Z500 field by the lead-time-dependent mean bias, our approach extends the forecast skill horizon for daily/instantaneous regime forecasts moderately by 1 day (from 13.5 to 14.5 days). Additionally, to our knowledge our study is the first to evaluate the multivariate aspects of forecast quality systematically for weather regime forecasts. Our method outperforms current practices in the multivariate aspect, as measured by the energy and variogram score. Still, our study shows that, even with advanced post-processing, weather regime prediction becomes difficult beyond 14 days, which likely points towards intrinsic limits of predictability for daily/instantaneous regime forecasts. The proposed method can easily be applied to operational weather regime forecasts, offering a neat alternative for cost- and time-efficient post-processing of real-time weather regime forecasts.},

This method has been applied first to a simple deterministic model and second to northern hemisphere (NH) 500‐mbar data. The dynamical model is governed by the fully nonlinear, equivalent‐barotropic vorticity equation on the sphere. Clusters of points in the model's phase space are associated either with a few persistent events or with many transient events. Two stationary clusters have patterns similar to unstable stationary model solutions, zonal or blocked. Transient clusters of wave trains serve as way stations between the stationary ones. For the NH data, cluster analysis was carried out in the subspace of the first seven empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). Stationary clusters are found in the low‐frequency band of more than 10 days, and transient clusters are found in the band‐pass frequency window between 2.5 and 6 days. In the low‐frequency band, three pairs of clusters determine EOFs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. They exhibit well‐known regional features, such as blocking, the Pacific/North American (PNA) pattern, and wave trains. Both model and low‐pass data show strong bimodality. Clusters in the band‐pass window show wavetrain patterns in the two jet exit regions.},

  abstract = {The widely accepted existence of an inherent limit of atmospheric predictability is usually attributed to weather’s sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This signature feature of chaos was first discovered in the Lorenz system, initially derived as a simplified model of thermal convection. In a recent study of a high-dimensional generalization of the Lorenz system, it was reported that the predictability of its chaotic solutions exhibits a non-monotonic dimensional dependence. Since raising the dimension of the Lorenz system is analogous to refining the model vertical resolution when viewed as a thermal convection model, it is questioned whether this non-monotonicity is also found in numerical weather prediction models. Predictability in the sense of sensitive dependence on initial conditions can be measured based on deviation time, that is, the time of threshold-exceeding deviations between the solutions with minute differences in initial conditions. Through ensemble experiments involving both the high-dimensional generalizations of the Lorenz system and real-case simulations by a numerical weather prediction model, this study demonstrates that predictability can depend non-monotonically on model vertical resolution. Further analysis shows that the spatial distribution of deviation time strongly contributes to this non-monotonicity. It is suggested that chaos, or sensitive dependence on initial conditions, leads to non-monotonic dependence on model vertical resolution of deviation time and, by extension, atmospheric predictability.},

Hyperbolic LCSs, which represent surfaces with maximal attraction or repulsion over a finite amount of time, are computed through a regularized least-squares approximation of the flow map gradient. Elliptic LCSs, which identify regions of coherent motion such as vortices and jets, are extracted using DBSCAN – a popular data clustering algorithm – combined with a systematic parameter selection strategy. We deploy these methods on various benchmark analytical flows and real-life experimental datasets ranging from oceanography to biology and show that they yield accurate results, despite sparse and noisy data. We also provide a lightweight computational implementation of these techniques as a user-friendly and straightforward Python code.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Atmospheric blocking can influence Arctic weather by diverting the mean westerly flow and steering cyclones polewards, bringing warm, moist air to high latitudes. Recent studies have shown that diabatic heating processes in the ascending warm conveyor belt branch of extratropical cyclones are relevant to blocking dynamics. This leads to the question of the extent to which diabatic heating associated with mid-latitude cyclones may influence high-latitude blocking and drive Arctic warm events. In this study we investigate the dynamics behind 50 extreme warm events of wintertime high-Arctic temperature anomalies during 1979–2016. Classifying the warm events based on blocking occurrence within three selected sectors, we find that 30 of these events are associated with a block over the Urals, featuring negative upper-level potential vorticity (PV) anomalies over central Siberia north of the Ural Mountains. Lagrangian back-trajectory calculations show that almost 60\,\% of the air parcels making up these negative PV anomalies experience lifting and diabatic heating (median 11\,K) in the 6\,d prior to the block. Further, almost 70\,\% of the heated trajectories undergo maximum heating in a compact region of the mid-latitude North Atlantic, temporally taking place between 6 and 1\,d before arriving in the blocking region. We also find anomalously high cyclone activity (on average five cyclones within this 5\,d heating window) within a sector northwest of the main heating domain. In addition, 10 of the 50 warm events are associated with blocking over Scandinavia. Around 60\,\% of the 6\,d back trajectories started from these blocks experience diabatic heating, of which 60\,\% undergo maximum heating over the North Atlantic but generally closer to the time of arrival in the block and further upstream relative to heated trajectories associated with Ural blocking. This study suggests that, in addition to the ability of blocks to guide cyclones northwards, Atlantic cyclones play a significant role in the dynamics of high-latitude blocking by providing low-PV air via moist-diabatic processes. This emphasizes the importance of the mutual interactions between mid-latitude cyclones and Eurasian blocking for wintertime Arctic warm extremes.},

However, potential changes in the blocking area (size), which can affect the spatiotemporal characteristics of the resulting extreme events, have not received much attention. Using two large-ensemble, fully coupled general circulation model (GCM) simulations, we show that the size of blocking events increases with climate change, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere (by as much as 17\%). Using a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model and a dimensional analysis technique, we derive a scaling law for the size of blocking events, which shows that area mostly scales with width of the jet times the Kuo scale (i.e., the length of stationary Rossby waves). The scaling law is validated in a range of idealized GCM simulations. Predictions of this scaling law agree well with changes in blocking events' size under climate change in fully coupled GCMs in winters but not in summers.},

Nakamura and Huang interpret the poorly understood origins of these systems as the meteorological equivalents of traffic congestion on a highway and show how they can be described by analogous mathematical theory. Climate change may affect the frequency of blocking as well as its geographic distribution, reflecting a simultaneous shift in the structure of the stationary atmospheric waves and the regional capacity of the jet stream.

Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a highway by using meteorological data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of wave activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream’s capacity for transient waves and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet stream’s proximity to capacity.},

  abstract = {Time evolutions of prominent blocking flow configurations over the North Pacific and Europe are compared based upon composites for the 30 strongest events observed during 27 recent winter seasons. Fluctuations associated with synoptic-scale migratory eddies have been filtered out before the compositing. A quasi-stationary wave train across the Atlantic is evident during the blocking amplification over Europe, while no counterpart is found to the west of the amplifying blocking over the North Pacific. Correlation between the tropopause-level potential vorticity (PV) and meridional wind velocity associated with the amplifying blocking is found to be negative over Europe in association with the anticyclonic evolution of the low-PV center, but it is almost zero over the North Pacific. Feedback from the synoptic-scale eddies, as evaluated in the form of 250-mb geopotential height tendency due to the eddy vorticity flux convergence, accounts for more than 75\% of the observed amplification for the Pacific blocking and less than 45\% for the European blocking. This difference is highlighted in two types of ‘‘contour advection with surgery’’ experiments. In one of them PV contours observed four days before the peak blocking time were advected by composite time series of the low-pass-filtered observational wind, and in the other experiment they were advected by the low-pass-filtered wind from which the transient eddy feedback evaluated as above had been removed at every time step. Hence, the latter data should be dominated by low-frequency dynamics. For the European blocking both experiments can reproduce the anticyclonic evolution of low-PV air within a blocking ridge as observed. For the Pacific blocking, in contrast, the observed intrusion of low-PV air into the higher latitudes cannot be reproduced without the transient feedback. Furthermore, in a barotropic model initialized with the composite 250-mb flow observed three days before the peak time, a simulated blocking development over the North Pacific is more sensitive to the insertion of the observed transient feedback than that over Europe. These results suggest that the incoming wave activity flux associated with a quasi-stationary Rossby wave train is of primary importance in the blocking formation over Europe, whereas the forcing by the synoptic-scale transients is indispensable to that over the North Pacific.},

A heat-trapping stable stratification ensued within the blocking anticyclone, raising the surface temperatures significantly. An upper-tropospheric wave breaking and the concomitant surface cyclogenesis off the coast of Alaska initiated the block formation. The regional local wave activity budget reveals that a localized diabatic source associated with this storm critically contributed to an enhanced zonal wave activity flux downstream, whose convergence over Canada drove the blocking. A simple reconstruction based on the observed wave activity budget predicts a 41 percent reduction in strength and a 10-degree eastward displacement of the block when the upstream diabatic source is reduced by just 30 percent.},

  abstract = {Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) produce a major fraction of precipitation in extratropical cyclones and modulate the large-scale extratropical circulation. Diabatic processes, in particular associated with cloud formation, influence the cross-isentropic ascent of WCBs into the upper troposphere and additionally modify the potential vorticity (PV) distribution, which influences the larger-scale flow. In this study we investigate heating and PV rates from all diabatic processes, including microphysics, turbulence, convection, and radiation, in a case study that occurred during the North Atlantic Waveguide and Downstream Impact Experiment (NAWDEX) campaign using the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) modeling framework. In particular, we consider all individual microphysical process rates that are implemented in ICON’s two-moment microphysics scheme, which sheds light on (i) which microphysical processes dominate the diabatic heating and PV structure in the WCB and (ii) which microphysical processes are the most active during the ascent and influence cloud formation and characteristics, providing a basis for detailed sensitivity experiments. For this purpose, diabatic heating and PV rates are integrated for the first time along online trajectories across nested grids with different horizontal resolutions. The convection-permitting simulation setup also takes the reduced aerosol concentrations over the North Atlantic into account. Our results confirm that microphysical processes are the dominant diabatic heating source during ascent. Near the cloud top longwave radiation cools WCB air parcels. Radiative heating and corresponding PV modification in the upper troposphere are non-negligible due to the longevity of the WCB cloud band. In the WCB ascent region, the process rates from turbulent heating and microphysics partially counteract each other. From all microphysical processes condensational growth of cloud droplets and vapor deposition on frozen hydrometeors most strongly influence diabatic heating and PV, while below-cloud evaporation strongly cools WCB air parcels prior to their ascent and increases their PV value. PV production is the strongest near the surface with substantial contributions from condensation, melting, evaporation, and vapor deposition. In the upper troposphere, PV is reduced by diabatic heating from vapor deposition, condensation, and radiation. Activation of cloud droplets as well as homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing processes have a negligible diabatic heating contribution, but their detailed representation is important for, e.g., hydrometeor size distributions. Generally, faster-ascending WCB trajectories are heated markedly more than more slowly ascending WCB trajectories, which is linked to larger initial specific humidity content providing a thermodynamic constraint on total microphysical heating. Yet, the total diabatic heating contribution of convectively ascending trajectories is relatively small due to their small fraction in this case study. Our detailed case study documents the effect of different microphysical processes implemented in ICON’s two-moment scheme for heating and PV rates in a WCB from a joint Eulerian and Lagrangian perspective. It emphasizes the predominant role of microphysical processes and provides a framework for future experiments on cloud microphysical sensitivities in WCBs.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Warm conveyor belts~(WCBs) are important airstreams in extratropical cyclones. They can influence large-scale flow evolution by modifying the potential vorticity~(PV) distribution during their cross-isentropic ascent. Although WCBs are typically described as slantwise-ascending and stratiform-cloud-producing airstreams, recent studies identified convective activity embedded within the large-scale WCB cloud band. However, the impacts of this WCB-embedded convection have not been investigated in detail. In this study, we systematically analyze the influence of embedded convection in an eastern North Atlantic WCB on the cloud and precipitation structure, on the PV~distribution, and on larger-scale flow. For this reason, we apply online trajectories in a high-resolution convection-permitting simulation and perform a composite analysis to compare quasi-vertically ascending convective WCB trajectories with typical slantwise-ascending WCB trajectories. We find that the convective WCB ascent leads to substantially stronger surface precipitation and the formation of graupel in the middle to upper troposphere, which is absent for the slantwise WCB category, indicating the key role of WCB-embedded convection for precipitation extremes. Compared to the slantwise WCB trajectories, the initial equivalent potential temperature of the convective WCB trajectories is higher, and the convective WCB trajectories originate from a region of larger potential instability, which gives rise to more intense cloud diabatic heating and stronger cross-isentropic ascent. Moreover, the signature of embedded convection is distinctly imprinted in the PV~structure. The diabatically generated low-level positive PV~anomalies, associated with a cyclonic circulation anomaly, are substantially stronger for the convective WCB trajectories. The slantwise WCB trajectories lead to the formation of a widespread region of low-PV air (that still have weakly positive PV~values) in the upper troposphere, in agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the convective WCB trajectories form mesoscale horizontal PV~dipoles at upper levels, with one pole reaching negative PV~values. On a larger scale, these individual mesoscale PV~anomalies can aggregate to elongated PV dipole bands extending from the convective updraft region, which are associated with coherent larger-scale circulation anomalies. An illustrative example of such a convectively generated PV~dipole band shows that within around 10\,h the negative PV~pole is advected closer to the upper-level waveguide, where it strengthens the isentropic PV~gradient and contributes to the formation of a jet streak. This suggests that the mesoscale PV anomalies produced by embedded convection upstream organize and persist for several hours and therefore can influence the synoptic-scale circulation. They thus can be dynamically relevant, influence the jet stream and (potentially) the downstream flow evolution, which are highly relevant aspects for medium-range weather forecast. Finally, our results imply that a distinction between slantwise and convective WCB trajectories is meaningful because the convective WCB trajectories are characterized by distinct properties.},

  abstract = {The characteristic and strongly precipitating cloud band near extratropical cyclones is associated with a coherent cross-isentropically ascending airstream, the warm conveyor belt (WCB). The WCB ascent characteristics and associated diabatic heating are influenced by cloud microphysical processes and environmental conditions in the WCB inflow region. The former relies on the cloud microphysical parametrisation, and the latter on initial and/or boundary conditions of thermodynamic variables. Altogether, this introduces uncertainty in numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasts of the WCB characteristics and ultimately the prediction of the large-scale midlatitude flow. We quantify the relative influence of perturbations on various cloud microphysical processes and WCB inflow temperature and moisture (via modification of sea-surface temperature) for a case study and thereby focus on uncertainty in WCB ascent behaviour, associated precipitation characteristics, and properties of the amplifying ridge downstream of the ascent region. To disentangle individual uncertainty contributions, we build a high-resolution 70-member perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) with the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) modelling framework. The PPE systematically combines parameter perturbations and samples the phase space spanned by parameter uncertainty ranges. Based on the PPE, computationally cheap statistical surrogate models are developed that subsequently facilitate variance-based sensitivity analysis for the target variables. Our results suggest that changes to environmental conditions controlling WCB inflow properties most strongly influence WCB ascent behaviour, total surface precipitation sums, and the ridge amplitude. Yet, the microphysical perturbations locally modify vertical velocity along WCB ascent and determine the precipitation efficiency, which affects meso-scale precipitation characteristics as well as the spatial distribution and intensity of precipitation. Moreover, the microphysical perturbations distinctly influence the large-scale flow pattern, albeit to a lesser extent than the perturbations applied to the WCB inflow characteristics.},

  abstract = {Ensemble forecasts depend on representations of model uncertainties. Here, we introduce a model uncertainty representation where a novel approach is taken to the established methodology of perturbing model parameters. The Stochastically Perturbed Parametrizations (SPP) scheme applies spatially and temporally varying perturbations to 20 parameters and variables in the ECMWF IFS model. The perturbed quantities are chosen from the IFS parametrizations of (a) turbulent diffusion and subgrid orography, (b) convection, (c) clouds and large‐scale precipitation, and (d) radiation. The perturbations are drawn from prescribed distributions.                            Numerous configurations of SPP are compared in experiments with the ECMWF ensemble forecasts at T                                L                              399 resolution up to 15 day lead times. Halving the standard deviations of the perturbations considerably reduces the ensemble spread. Smaller variations of the standard deviations lead to minor changes to the ensemble spread. Experiments with different space and time correlations for the perturbations suggest optimal correlation scales of 2000 km and 72 h. SPP displays a lower skill for upper‐air variables in the medium range than the current operational model uncertainty scheme Stochastically Perturbed Parametrization Tendencies (SPPT) for a given set of fixed initial‐state perturbations. However, in short ranges the two schemes display similar skill. Moreover, verification against surface observations shows SPP is more skilful than SPPT in 2 m temperature for the first couple of forecast days. We show that the direct perturbation of cloud (and radiation) processes in SPP has a greater impact on radiative fluxes than the indirect perturbation via SPPT. SPP also produces a better model climate for a range of variables when comparing long model integrations with the two schemes, indicating the potential advantage of a physically consistent model uncertainty representation. A comparison of the tendency perturbations introduced by SPP and SPPT suggests that the two schemes represent different aspects of model uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Amplified Arctic ice loss in recent decades has been linked to the increased occurrence of extreme mid-latitude weather. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive, however. One potential link occurs through the ocean as the loss of sea ice and glacial ice leads to increased freshwater fluxes into the ocean. Thus, in this study, we examine the link between North Atlantic freshwater anomalies and European summer weather. Combining a comprehensive set of observational products, we show that stronger freshwater anomalies are associated with a sharper sea surface temperature front between the subpolar and the subtropical North Atlantic in winter, an increased atmospheric instability above the sea surface temperature front, and a large-scale atmospheric circulation that induces a northward shift in the North Atlantic Current, strengthening the sea surface temperature front. In the following summer, the lower-tropospheric winds are deflected northward along the enhanced sea surface temperature front and the European coastline, forming part of a large-scale atmospheric circulation anomaly that is associated with warmer and drier weather over Europe. The identified statistical links are significant on timescales from years to decades and indicate an enhanced predictability of European summer weather at least a winter in advance, with the exact regions and amplitudes of the warm and dry weather anomalies over Europe being sensitive to the location, strength, and extent of North Atlantic freshwater anomalies in the preceding winter.},

  abstract = {The prediction skill of sub-seasonal forecast models is evaluated for seven year-round weather regimes in the Atlantic–European region. Reforecasts based on models from three prediction centers are considered and verified against weather regimes obtained from ERA-Interim reanalysis. Results show that predicting weather regimes as a proxy for the large-scale circulation outperforms the prediction of raw geopotential height. Greenland blocking tends to have the longest year-round skill horizon for all three models, especially in winter. On the other hand, the skill is lowest for the European blocking regime for all three models, followed by the Scandinavian blocking regime. Furthermore, all models struggle to forecast flow situations that cannot be assigned to a weather regime (so-called no regime), in comparison with weather regimes. Related to this, variability in the occurrence of no regime, which is most frequent in the transition seasons, partly explains the predictability gap between transition seasons and winter and summer. We also show that models have difficulties in discriminating between related regimes. This can lead to misassignments in the predicted regime during flow situations in which related regimes manifest. Finally, we document the changes in skill between model versions, showing important improvements for the ECMWF and NCEP models. This study is the first multi-model assessment of year-round weather regimes in the Atlantic–European domain. It advances our understanding of the predictive skill for weather regimes, reveals strengths and weaknesses of each model, and thus increases our confidence in the forecasts and their usefulness for decision-making.},

IPCC studies using different methods of event attribution have been assessed together, highlighting that these differences are smaller than the academic discourse on the methods suggests. This development raised two important research questions the science needs to answer: First, how do we formally combine attribution statements using highly conditional methods with probabilistic assessments of how climate change alters the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events? Second, under what circumstances are individual attribution studies still necessary and to what extent do existing attribution studies provide enough information to answer societal questions? Furthermore, the scientific development still leaves important gaps, particularly in countries of the Global South, leading to ethical questions around the need and requirement of attribution of extreme events in policy contexts, informing adaptation and loss and damage and the role of vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Non-stationary systems are found throughout the world, from climate patterns under the influence of variation in carbon dioxide concentration to brain dynamics driven by ascending neuromodulation. Accordingly, there is a need for methods to analyze non-stationary processes, and yet, most time-series analysis methods that are used in practice on important problems across science and industry make the simplifying assumption of stationarity. One important problem in the analysis of non-stationary systems is the problem class that we refer to as parameter inference from a non-stationary unknown process (PINUP). Given an observed time series, this involves inferring the parameters that drive non-stationarity of the time series, without requiring knowledge or inference of a mathematical model of the underlying system. Here, we review and unify a diverse literature of algorithms for PINUP. We formulate the problem and categorize the various algorithmic contributions into those based on (1) dimension reduction, (2) statistical time-series features, (3) prediction error, (4) phase-space partitioning, (5) recurrence plots, and (6) Bayesian inference. This synthesis will allow researchers to identify gaps in the literature and will enable systematic comparisons of different methods. We also demonstrate that the most common systems that existing methods are tested on—notably, the non-stationary Lorenz process and logistic map—are surprisingly easy to perform well on using simple statistical features like windowed mean and variance, undermining the practice of using good performance on these systems as evidence of algorithmic performance. We then identify more challenging problems that many existing methods perform poorly on and which can be used to drive methodological advances in the field. Our results unify disjoint scientific contributions to analyzing the non-stationary systems and suggest new directions for progress on the PINUP problem and the broader study of non-stationary phenomena.},

  abstract = {Historical evidence is reviewed to show that what Ed Lorenz meant by the iconic phrase ‘the butterfly effect’ is not at all captured by the notion of sensitive dependence on initial conditions in low-order chaos. Rather, as presented in his 1969 Tellus paper, Lorenz intended the phrase to describe the existence of an absolute finite-time predicability barrier in certain multi-scale fluid systems, implying a breakdown of continuous dependence on initial conditions for large enough forecast lead times. To distinguish from ‘mere’ sensitive dependence, the effect discussed in Lorenz’s Tellus paper is referred to as ‘the real butterfly effect’. Theoretical evidence for such a predictability barrier in a fluid described by the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations is discussed. Whilst it is still an open question whether the Navier–Stokes equation has this property, evidence from both idealized atmospheric simulators and analysis of operational weather forecasts suggests that the real butterfly effect exists in an asymptotic sense, i.e. for initial-time atmospheric perturbations that are small in scale and amplitude compared with (weather) scales of interest, but still large in scale and amplitude compared with variability in the viscous subrange. Despite this, the real butterfly effect is an intermittent phenomenon in the atmosphere, and its presence can be signalled a priori, and hence mitigated, by ensemble forecast methods.},

This Perspective also surveys the ways in which introducing stochasticity into the parameterized representations of subgrid processes in comprehensive weather and climate models has improved the skill of forecasts and has reduced systematic model error, notably in simulating persistent flow anomalies. The pertinence of stochasticity is also discussed in the context of the question of how many bits of useful information are contained in the numerical representations of variables, a question that is critical for the design of next-generation climate models. The accuracy of fluid simulation may be further increased if future-g eneration supercomputer hardware becomes partially stochastic.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty analysis of models has received increasing attention over the last two decades in water resources research. However, a significant part of the community is still reluctant to embrace the estimation of uncertainty in hydrological and hydraulic modeling. In this paper, we summarize and explore seven common arguments: uncertainty analysis is not necessary given physically realistic models; uncertainty analysis cannot be used in hydrological and hydraulic hypothesis testing; uncertainty (probability) distributions cannot be understood by policy makers and the public; uncertainty analysis cannot be incorporated into the decision‐making process; uncertainty analysis is too subjective; uncertainty analysis is too difficult to perform; uncertainty does not really matter in making the final decision. We will argue that none of the arguments against uncertainty analysis rehearsed are, in the end, tenable. Moreover, we suggest that one reason why the application of uncertainty analysis is not normal and expected part of modeling practice is that mature guidance on methods and applications does not exist. The paper concludes with suggesting that a Code of Practice is needed as a way of formalizing such guidance.},

  abstract = {Near-term climate predictions such as decadal climate forecasts are increasingly being used to guide adaptation measures. For near-term probabilistic predictions to be useful, systematic errors of the forecasting systems have to be corrected. While methods for the calibration of probabilistic forecasts are readily available, these have to be adapted to the specifics of decadal climate forecasts including the long time horizon of decadal climate forecasts, lead-timedependent systematic errors (drift) and the errors in the representation of long-term changes and variability. These features are compounded by small ensemble sizes to describe forecast uncertainty and a relatively short period for which typically pairs of reforecasts and observations are available to estimate calibration parameters. We introduce the Decadal Climate Forecast Recalibration Strategy (DeFoReSt), a parametric approach to recalibrate decadal ensemble forecasts that takes the above specifics into account. DeFoReSt optimizes forecast quality as measured by the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Using a toy model to generate synthetic forecast observation pairs, we demonstrate the positive effect on forecast quality in situations with pronounced and limited predictability. Finally, we apply DeFoReSt to decadal surface temperature forecasts from the MiKlip prototype system and find consistent, and sometimes considerable, improvements in forecast quality compared with a simple calibration of the lead-time-dependent systematic errors.},

Here, we propose a common mechanism for the generation of persistent longitudinal planetary-scale high-amplitude patterns of the atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Those patterns—with zonal wave numbers m = 6, 7, or 8—are characteristic of the above extremes. We show that these patterns might result from trapping within midlatitude waveguides of free synoptic waves with zonal wave numbers k ≈ m. Usually, the quasistationary dynamical response with the above wave numbers               m               to climatological mean thermal and orographic forcing is weak. Such midlatitude waveguides, however, may favor a strong magnification of that response through quasiresonance.},

Changes in blocking frequencies due to Arctic amplification and sea ice loss may enhance extreme events6,7, but the mechanisms potentially involved in such changes are under discussion8–11. Current theories for blocking are essentially based on dry dynamics and do not directly take moist processes into account12–17. Here we analyse a 21-year climatology of blocking from reanalysis data with a Lagrangian approach, to quantify the release of latent heat in clouds along the trajectories that enter the blocking systems. We show that 30 to 45\% of the air masses involved in Northern Hemisphere blocking are heated by more than 2 K—with a median heating of more than 7 K—in the three days before their arrival in the blocking system. This number increases to 60 to 70\% when considering a seven-day period. Our analysis reveals that, in addition to quasi-horizontal advection of air with low potential vorticity12–15, ascent from lower levels associated with latent heating in clouds is of first-order importance for the formation and maintenance of blocking. We suggest that this process should be accounted for when investigating future changes in atmospheric blocking.},

Here we decompose the forced response of daily regional scale extreme precipitation in climate-model simulations into thermodynamic and dynamic contributions using a robust physical diagnostic8. We show that thermodynamics alone would lead to a spatially homogeneous fractional increase, which is consistent across models and dominates the sign of the change in most regions. However, the dynamic contribution modifies regional responses, amplifying increases, for instance, in the Asian monsoon region, but weakening them across the Mediterranean, South Africa and Australia. Over subtropical oceans, the dynamic contribution is strong enough to cause robust regional decreases in extreme precipitation, which may partly result from a poleward circulation shift. The dynamic contribution is key to reducing uncertainties in future projections of regional extreme precipitation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The role of moisture for extratropical atmospheric dynamics is particularly pronounced within warm conveyor belts (WCBs), which are characterized by intense latent heat release and precipitation formation. Based on the WCB climatology for the period 1979–2010 presented in Part I, two important aspects of the WCB moisture cycle are investigated: the evaporative moisture sources and the relevance of WCBs for total and extreme precipitation. The most important WCB moisture source regions are the western North Atlantic and North Pacific in boreal winter and the South Pacific and western South Atlantic in boreal summer. The strongest continental moisture source is South America. During winter, source locations are mostly local and over the ocean, and the associated surface evaporation occurs primarily during 5 days prior to the start of the WCB ascent. Long-range transport and continental moisture recycling are much more important in summer, when a substantial fraction of the evaporation occurs more than 10 days before the ascent. In many extratropical regions, WCB moisture supply is related to anomalously strong surface evaporation, enforced by low relative humidity and high winds over the ocean. WCBs are highly relevant for total and extreme precipitation in many parts of the extratropics. For instance, the percentage of precipitation extremes directly associated with a WCB is higher than 70\%–80\% over southeastern North America, Japan, and large parts of southern South America. A proper representation of WCBs in weather forecast and climate models is thus essential for the correct prediction of extreme precipitation events.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The stochastically perturbed parametrisation tendency (SPPT) scheme is a well‐established technique in ensemble forecasting to address model uncertainty by introducing perturbations into the tendencies provided by the physics parametrisations. The magnitude of the perturbations scales with the local net parametrisation tendency, resulting in large perturbations where diabatic processes are active. Rapidly ascending air streams, such as warm conveyor belts (WCBs) and organized tropical convection, are often driven by cloud diabatic processes and are therefore prone to such perturbations. This study investigates the effects of SPPT and initial condition perturbations on rapidly ascending air streams by computing trajectories in sensitivity experiments with the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble prediction system, which are set up to disentangle the effects of initial conditions and physics perturbations. The results demonstrate that SPPT systematically increases the frequency of rapidly ascending air streams. The effect is observed globally, but is enhanced in regions where the latent heating along the trajectories is larger. Despite the frequency changes, there are only minor modifications to the physical properties of the trajectories due to SPPT. In contrast to SPPT, initial condition perturbations do not affect WCBs and tropical convection systematically. An Eulerian perspective on vertical velocities reveals that SPPT increases the frequency of strong upward motions compared with experiments with unperturbed model physics. Consistent with the altered vertical motions, precipitation rates are also affected by the model physics perturbations. The unperturbed control member shows the same characteristics as the experiments without SPPT regarding rapidly ascending air streams. We make use of this to corroborate the findings from the sensitivity experiments by analyzing the differences between perturbed and unperturbed members in operational ensemble forecasts of ECMWF. Finally, we give an explanation of how symmetric, zero‐mean perturbations can lead to a unidirectional response when applied in a nonlinear system.},

  abstract = {Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) are rapidly ascending air streams associated with extratropical cyclones. WCBs exert a substantial influence on the evolution of the large-scale midlatitude flow and have previously been related to increased forecast uncertainty in case studies. This study provides a first systematic investigation of the role of WCBs for errors in medium-range ensemble forecasts in the Atlantic–European region. The study is enabled through a unique data set, allowing for a Lagrangian detection of WCBs in three years of operational ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. By analysing the relationship between commonly used error metrics of variables that characterise the large-scale flow and WCBs, the study aims to shed light on the question of the extent to which WCBs act as a source of forecast errors and as an amplifier of pre-existing errors in a state-of-the-art global operational numerical weather prediction model. We show that forecasts with high WCB activity are on average characterised by an amplified Rossby-wave pattern and anticyclonic flow anomalies downstream. We find that the forecast skill is generally reduced when the WCB activity is high, and that WCB activity is particularly increased when the error growth is largest. To establish a causal relationship, we employ two composite approaches. The first focuses on the time of largest error growth and the second calculates normalised forecast error fields centered on WCB objects. Both approaches yield a consistent picture: anomalously high errors are initially associated with misrepresentations of an upstream trough. In regions of WCB ascent and outflow, the errors grow rapidly in terms of magnitude and scale and are projected onto the upper-level large-scale circulation. We also find indications that WCBs can cause errors even when the upstream flow is well represented. Notwithstanding, evidence is robust for WCBs acting as an amplifier of forecast uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Objective methods for identifying and quantifying atmospheric blocking have been developed over recent decades, primarily targeting North Atlantic blocks. Differences arise from these methods, leading to changes in the resultant blocking climatology. To understand these differences, and better inform future assessments built on quantitative detection of blocks, this paper examines blocking properties produced by three different objective detection algorithms over the global extratropics. Blocking criteria examined include 500 hPa geopotential height anomaly ({$\mkern1mu$}Z∗{$\mkern1mu$}), column-averaged potential vorticity anomaly ({$\mkern1mu$}PV∗{$\mkern1mu$}), and 500 hPa geopotential height gradient (AGP). Results are analyzed for blocking climatologies and for instantaneous blocking patterns, as well as distributions of block size, speed, duration, and distance traveled. The results emphasize physical characteristics of the flow field and the subsequent blocking regions that emerge; overall, PV∗ and Z∗ blocked regions often have higher pattern correlation and spatial similarity, though these two methods also display high agreement with AGP in some instances.Z∗ finds the largest (and greatest number of) blocked regions, while PV∗-detected regions are smallest in all instances except Southern Hemisphere winter. In some cases, PV∗ tracks a nearby jet streak, leading to differences with height-based algorithms. All three algorithms detect some questionable low-latitude blocks that are stationary and persist but do not impair zonal flow, although at different times. Therefore, careful consideration of the algorithm biases is important in future blocking studies. For example, linking extreme weather to detected blocking could vary substantially depending on the algorithm used.},

  abstract = {Abstract        Large-scale atmospheric variability can be summarised using a small number of recurring patterns called \textbackslash say\{weather regimes\}. The properties of weather regimes have been widely investigated in the literature, including through the \textbackslash say\{local dimension\}: an instantaneous geometrical estimate of the number of degrees of freedom, emanating from the multifractal formalism of dynamical systems. In atmospheric and ocean science, the local dimension has been interpreted as a measure of predictability. The different weather regimes display differing values of local dimension. It was also shown that the local dimension decreases when the atmosphere projects most strongly on a single weather regime, and increases during regime transitions. This was interpreted as confirming the physical grounding and dynamical footprint of weather regimes. However, the drivers of local dimension variations remain to be elucidated. In particular, recent work has shown that variations in local dimension originate not only from changes in multifractal geometric properties but also from changes in sampling density. In this work, we propose a methodology to isolate the density-based variations of local dimension for the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the North-Atlantic. We build \textbackslash say\{stochastic twins\} of the atmosphere in the space of truncated empirical orthogonal functions, based on the Gaussian mixture model used to define weather regimes from ERA5-reanalysis 500 hPa geopotential height fields. These stochastic twins bear a similar sampling density as the atmosphere, but they are not multifractal and therefore they have a constant local geometry and a fixed number of degrees of freedom. Estimates of density-based variations of local dimension using stochastic twins allow to explain more than 50\% of the total variations of local dimension, proving that a large fraction of local dimension variations is not related to changes in local geometry. The dimension estimated from stochastic twins also allows to reproduce the previously observed decrease of dimension near peak weather regime index, indicating that this universal behavior is a density-based phenomenon, and cannot be attributed to the multifractal nature of atmospheric circulation. However, the sampling density-based variations of the local dimension can still provide useful information on the properties of weather regimes. Additionally, we show that the full range of local dimension variations cannot be explained by density-based estimates alone, so that the remaining variability is likely due to changes in local geometry, and therefore in number of degrees of freedom. The methodology presented in this paper can be applied to any observed system whose sampling distribution can be approximated, and provides a new means to interpret local dimension estimates of real-world atmospheric or ocean data.},

  abstract = {Rossby-wave packets (RWPs) along the midlatitude jet are a fundamental ingredient of extratropical dynamics. RWPs have been linked to enhanced atmospheric predictability and the occurrence of extreme weather events. We here investigate the predictability of Northern Hemispheric RWPs as physical entities, defined by enhanced values of the Rossby-wave envelope field. Using a catalogue of RWPs identified and tracked in reanalysis data, we analyze RWP predictability in a 19-year period of NOAA GEFSv12 reforecasts. Our analysis adopts the so-called distance and amplitude score (DAS), a verification metric that avoids both the double-penalty issue of field-based verification of coherent features and the complications of an object-based approach. Applied to the envelope field, forecast errors defined by this metric asymptote towards saturation, but do not completely reach saturation within the 10 days lead time available to this study. The growth rate of the median DAS is highest initially and decreases with lead time. This is a nontrivial result, because the underlying envelope field largely de-emphasizes phase information, but still exhibits very similar error-growth characteristics to fields that contain the full phase information. Variations in RWP predictability are dominated by the stage of the RWP life cycle, with higher predictability found for the propagation stage than the onset and decay stages. In addition, RWP predictability exhibits a seasonal cycle, with higher predictability in winter than in summer. Controlling for seasonality and the stage of the life cycle, we find that (i) high-amplitude RWPs exhibit higher predictability than low-amplitude RWPs up to 6 days lead time and (ii) there is a general pattern of relatively high predictability over Eurasia. Finally, predictability of the propagating stage is higher if forecasts are initialized after RWP onset than if initialized before onset. In this sense, RWP onset acts as a predictability barrier to the subsequent propagation stage.},

Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP)               1               , which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations               2,3               . However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk. Overall, MLWP has remained less accurate and reliable than state-of-the-art NWP ensemble forecasts. Here we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, ENS, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather~Forecasts               4               . GenCast is an ML weather prediction method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25° latitude–longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8\,min. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.2\% of 1,320 targets we evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, in which crucial weather-dependent decisions are made more accurately and efficiently.},

The bootstrapping technique is used to investigate the convergence of sampling error for a range of surface and midtroposphere variables. Convergence is generally observed for the mean and the standard deviation, but not for the 95th percentile, especially in strong forcing. Additionally, maps of uncertainty are introduced, which allow for a more detailed analysis of the spatial pattern of uncertainty and facilitate the interpretation of the sources and evolution of forecast uncertainty in different synoptic forcing conditions. It is found that convection significantly increases uncertainty in model variables and shapes the spatial uncertainty pattern, with weak forcing leading to patchy uncertainty and strong forcing resulting in a more coherent pattern due to large convective systems. Overall, the main result of this work is the strong connection between uncertainty of forecast variables and convection, with synoptic forcing being crucial in determining the spatial distribution and uncertainty evolution within 24 h.},

  abstract = {Successful weather forecasts on subseasonal time-scales can support societal preparedness and mitigate the impacts of extreme events. Heatwaves in particular can, in certain cases, be predicted on time-scales of several weeks in advance. Heatwave predictability is commonly assessed in terms of heatwave intensity. In addition to heatwave intensity, we assess the predictability of heatwave onset and duration, which are crucial components of early-warning systems and emergency preparedness plans. The forecast skill of heatwaves is investigated over the European region in the subseasonal forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The heatwaves are first detected in ERA-Interim reanalysis data over the period 1998–2017 and then allocated into six clusters in the following regions: Black Sea (BSea), Russia (Ru), Western Europe (WEu), North Sea (NSea), Scandinavia (Sc), and Eastern Europe (EEu). The European regions with the highest predictability in heatwave onset and duration are the clusters Ru, Sc, and NSea. The WEu cluster has the lowest bias in heatwave intensity and is found to be the most predictable region in terms of the number of heatwave events with predictable intensity at lead week 2. Heatwave intensity is generally found to be the most predictable characteristic of European heatwaves, being predictable by the model ensemble mean up to lead times of 3 weeks. Furthermore, this analysis identifies the most predictable heatwaves, allowing for a further investigation of the physical mechanisms and heatwave characteristics leading to enhanced heatwave forecast skill over different European regions.},

We apply a regularized vector autoregressive clustering technique to identify recurrent and persistent states of atmospheric circulation patterns in the North Atlantic sector (110°W-0°E, 20°N-90°N). In order to analyze the dynamics associated with the resulting cluster-based models, we define a time-dependent linear delayed map with a switching sequence set a priori by the cluster affiliations at each time step. Using a method for computing the covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) over various time windows, we produce sets of mixed singular vectors (for short windows) and approximate the asymptotic CLVs (for longer windows). The growth rates and alignment of the resulting time-dependent vectors are then analyzed. We find that the window chosen to compute the vectors acts as a filter on the dynamics. For short windows, the alignment and changes in growth rates are indicative of individual transitions between persistent states. For long windows, we observe an emergent annual signal manifest in the alignment of the CLVs characteristic of the observed seasonality in the NAO index. Analysis of the average finite-time dimension reveals the NAO               −               as the most unstable state relative to the NAO               +               , with persistent AR states largely stable.

We first derive a data-driven reduced-order model to characterize persistent geopotential height anomalies over Europe and Western Asia (Eurasia) over the period 1979–present from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction v1 reanalysis. We then characterize and compare the MSVs and SVs of each persistent state over Eurasia for particular lead-times from a day to over a week. Finally, we compare the spatiotemporal properties of SVs and MSVs in an examination of the dynamics of the 2010 Russian heatwave. We show that MSVs provide a systematic approach to generate initial forecast perturbations projected onto relevant expanding directions in phase space for typical NWP forecast lead-times.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) affect the atmospheric dynamics in midlatitudes and are highly relevant for total and extreme precipitation in many parts of the extratropics. Thus, these airstreams and their effect on midlatitude weather should be well represented in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models. This study applies newly developed convolutional neural network (CNN) models which allow the identification of footprints of WCB inflow, ascent, and outflow from a limited number of predictor fields at comparably low spatiotemporal resolution. The goal of the study is to demonstrate the versatile applicability of the CNN models to different datasets and that their application yields qualitatively and quantitatively similar results as their trajectory-based counterpart, which is most frequently used to objectively identify WCBs. The trajectory-based approach requires data at higher spatiotemporal resolution, which are often not available, and is computationally more expensive. First, an application to reanalyses reveals that the well-known relationship between WCB ascent and extratropical cyclones as well as between WCB outflow and blocking anticyclones is also found for WCB footprints identified with the CNN models. Second, the application to Japanese 55-year reanalyses shows how the CNN models may be used to identify erroneous predictor fields that deteriorate the models' reliability. Third, a verification of WCBs in operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble forecasts for three Northern Hemisphere winters reveals systematic biases over the North Atlantic with both the trajectory-based approach and the CNN models. The ensemble forecasts' skill tends to be lower when being evaluated with the trajectory approach due to the fine-scale structure of WCB footprints in comparison to the rather smooth CNN-based WCB footprints. A final example demonstrates the applicability of the CNN models to a convection-permitting simulation with the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) NWP model. Our study illustrates that deep learning methods can be used efficiently to support process-oriented understanding of forecast error and model biases and opens numerous directions for future research.},

The identification of WCBs usually involves Lagrangian air parcel trajectories that ascend from the lower to the upper troposphere within 2\,d. This requires expensive computations and numerical data with high spatial and temporal resolution, which are often not available from standard output. This study introduces a novel framework that aims to predict the footprints of the WCB inflow, ascent, and outflow stages over the Northern Hemisphere from instantaneous gridded fields using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). With its comparably low computational costs and relying on standard model output alone, the new diagnostic enables the systematic investigation of WCBs in large data sets such as ensemble reforecast or climate model projections, which are mostly not suited for trajectory calculations. Building on the insights from a logistic regression approach of a previous study, the CNNs are trained using a combination of meteorological parameters as predictors and trajectory-based WCB footprints as predictands. Validation of the networks against the trajectory-based data set confirms that the CNN models reliably replicate the climatological frequency of WCBs as well as their footprints at instantaneous time steps. The CNN models significantly outperform previously developed logistic regression models. Including time-lagged information on the occurrence of WCB ascent as a predictor for the inflow and outflow stages further improves the models' skill considerably. A companion study demonstrates versatile applications of the CNNs in different data sets including the verification of WCBs in ensemble forecasts. Overall, the diagnostic demonstrates how deep learning methods may be used to investigate the representation of weather systems and their related processes in NWP and climate models in order to shed light on forecast uncertainty and systematic biases from a process-oriented perspective.},

A realistic representation of RWPs is essential for a skillful prediction of the day-to-day weather and its extremes. Using an objective RWP tracking technique, this study verifies the representation of RWPs for all models in the Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) Prediction Project Database. Consistent with reanalyses, the reforecasts show one RWP every 4 days. The three models with the coarsest grid spacing tend to overestimate the propagation distance due to a negative RWP decay frequency bias over the Atlantic-European sector. A verification of atmospheric blocking suggests that this bias is related to a negative blocking frequency bias in the same region. The biases are reduced in models with finer grid spacing. However, that this bias reduction is not only dependent on the grid spacing highlights the effect of the different representation of key physical processes on RWPs and blocking.},

In fact the two problems—inequality and democratic erosion—are linked. In a large cross-national statistical study of risk factors for democratic erosion, we establish that economic inequality is one of the strongest predictors of where and when democracy erodes. Even wealthy and longstanding democracies are vulnerable if they are highly unequal (though national wealth might provide some resiliency). The association between inequality and risk of democratic backsliding is robust, and holds under different measures and structures of both income inequality and wealth inequality. The association is unlikely to be a case of reverse causation. For concerned citizens seeking to understand why so many democracies are eroding and how to stop this process, our study indicates that policies for ameliorating inequality are a promising path forward.},

  abstract = {Convective‐scale ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) are often initialized with downscaled initial condition perturbations (ICPs) from a global coarser EPS. Although downscaled ICPs have been shown to have a positive impact at short ranges, they cannot represent the uncertainty at small scales. Hence, there is a spin‐up of around 9–12 h until the forecast perturbations develop realistic small‐scale structures. On the other hand, ensemble data assimilation (EDA) is a common approach to obtain initial perturbations at all scales resolved by the numerical model. However, the high computational cost of EDA systems severely limits their size and their resolution. An alternative cheaper method to derive small‐scale ICPs is considered here, based on a random sampling of the model background‐error covariances. This article provides an evaluation of random and EDA‐based IC perturbation methods against the baseline downscaling approach, in the framework of the pre‐operational convective‐scale EPS developed at Météo‐France with the AROME‐France model at a 2.5 km horizontal resolution.             Small‐scale IC perturbation methods are shown to significantly improve the short‐range EPS performance for surface weather variables. For 2 m temperature and 10 m wind speed, random ICPs give as good results as the EDA, owing to the very short spin‐up of random perturbations. Precipitation forecasts are also strongly improved during the first six forecast hours, especially when initial humidity perturbations are included. The sensitivity of the EPS performance to the EDA size, horizontal resolution and representation of model errors is discussed. It is found that a large fraction of the initial uncertainty can be properly described with an EDA of reasonable size and at a slightly coarser resolution than the EPS.},

While there has always been some concern that these pressures may compel some to defect from the scientific research ethos—i.e., fail to make genuine contributions to the production of knowledge or to the training of an expert workforce—the focus has largely been on the actions of lone individuals. Recently, however, reports of coordinated scientific fraud activities have increased. Some suggest that the ease of communication provided by the internet and open-access publishing have created the conditions for the emergence of entities—paper mills (i.e., sellers of mass-produced low quality and fabricated research), brokers (i.e., conduits between producers and publishers of fraudulent research), predatory journals, who do not conduct any quality controls on submissions—that facilitate systematic scientific fraud. Here, we demonstrate through case studies that i) individuals have cooperated to publish papers that were eventually retracted in a number of journals, ii) brokers have enabled publication in targeted journals at scale, and iii), within a field of science, not all subfields are equally targeted for scientific fraud. Our results reveal some of the strategies that enable the entities promoting scientific fraud to evade interventions. Our final analysis suggests that this ability to evade interventions is enabling the number of fraudulent publications to grow at a rate far outpacing that of legitimate science.},

The Service provides the high-resolution deterministic Copernicus European Regional Reanalysis (CERRA), run at a horizontal resolution of 5.5 km, a 10-member ensemble run at 11-km resolution as well as an offline surface analysis, CERRA-Land. CERRA-EDA uses an ensemble data assimilation (EDA) technique to perturb the initial condition of the different members. Apart from the horizontal resolution the CERRA and CERRA-EDA setups are the same; for example, the same data assimilation scheme, same physics parameterization as well as the same vertical levels. These new systems are built from HARMONIE cy40 version, including some back-phased physics from a newer model version (cy42). Conventional observations, satellite-based radiances, atmospheric motion vector winds and bending angle from radio occultation observations are used. In addition, ground-based zenith total delay (ZTD) from global navigational satellite systems (GNSS) and local surface observations, rescued from historical archives at the local National Meteorological Services, are used. Another new feature is the construction of the background error statistics for the data assimilation. Information from the ensemble run, CERRA-EDA, is used in the derivation of the background error statistics for the high-resolution CERRA runs. These background error statistics are updated every second day. By doing so, daily environment variation is taken into account as well as all variations over the 37 years of production. The reanalyses and reforecasts from CERRA show an added value compared to the global ERA5 for almost all variables at the surface level. This becomes particularly clear when selecting smaller areas with complex terrain where the high resolution is beneficial. In the free atmosphere it is primarily the analyses and short forecasts, 3–6 hours, that give an added value.},

Here, we focus on short‐lead‐time (12\,h) reliability in the nonlinear background forecasts of the Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA) from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). A ‘reliability budget’, derived from consistency arguments, is used to separate the mean‐squared departures of the ensemble mean (relative to observations) into bias, ensemble variance and observation‐error contributions, along with a residual that indicates a deficiency in reliability. At these short lead times, the residual is found to be sensitive, in a local manner, to the assignment of observation errors and to the parametrization of ‘stochastic physics’, which accounts for the deficit in a model's error growth rate. In particular, the results highlight the importance of the stochastic physics parametrization to represent error growth rates fully in convective regions and suggest that current stochastic physics may be too active in subtropical anticyclones, where the mid‐tropospheric meteorology is largely characterized by time‐mean descent and radiative cooling. Other results demonstrate how the reliability budget can be used to tune observation errors, which leads to an improvement in diagnosed background reliability. Although there remains some ambiguity in the attribution of deficiencies, the budget represents a useful additional tool that can help stimulate improvements in model stochastic error representation and observation‐error estimates. Such improvements should help facilitate the development of more reliable ensemble forecasts in future.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In global numerical weather prediction, the strongest contribution to ensemble variance growth over the first few days is at synoptic scales. Hence it is particularly important to ensure that this synoptic-scale variance is reliable. Here we focus on wintertime synoptic-scale growth in the North Atlantic storm track. In the 12\,h background forecasts of the Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), we find that initial variance growth at synoptic scales tends to be organized in particular flow situations, such as during the deepening of cyclones (cyclogenesis). Both baroclinic and diabatic aspects may be involved in the overall growth rate. However, evaluation of reliability through use of an extended error–spread equation indicates that the ECMWF ensemble forecast, which is initialized from the EDA but with additional singular vector perturbations, appears to have too much variance at a lead time of 2\,d and that this over-spread is associated with cyclogenesis situations. Comparison of variance growth rates and reliability with other forecast systems within The International Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive indicates some sensitivity to the model or its initialization. For the ECMWF ensemble forecast, sensitivity experiments suggest that a large part of the total day-2 spread in cyclogenesis cases is associated with the growth of EDA uncertainty, but up to 25\,\% can be associated with the additional singular vector perturbations to the initial conditions and up to 25\,\% with the representation of model uncertainty. The sensitivities of spread to resolution, the explicit representation of convection, and the assimilation of local observations are also considered. The study raises the question of whether the EDA now successfully represents initial uncertainty (and the enhanced growth rates associated with cyclogenesis) to the extent that singular vector perturbations could be reduced in magnitude to improve storm track reliability. This would leave a more seamless forecast system, allowing short-range diagnostics to better help improve the model and model-uncertainty representation, which could be beneficial throughout the forecast range.},

Among the detected structures were regions of hyperbolic nature resembling stable manifolds from classical examples, divergent and convergent zones, and groups of drifters that moved more coherently and stayed closer together than the rest of the drifters. Many methods highlighted the same structures, but there were differences too. Overall, five out of seven methods provided useful information about the geometry of transport within the domain spanned by the drifters, whereas the path length and correlation dimension methods were less useful than others.},

The basic principles of the CM are explained and the CM is tested in a variety of examples, both idealized and realistic, and in different reference frames. Two measures of complexity are explored in detail: the correlation dimension of trajectory, and a new measure – the ergodicity defect. Both measures yield structures that strongly resemble Lagrangian coherent structures in all of the examples considered. Since the CM uses properties of individual trajectories, and not separation rates between closely spaced trajectories, it may have advantages for the analysis of ocean float and drifter data sets in which trajectories are typically widely and non-uniformly spaced.},

  abstract = {This study presents a complete assessment of the use of different observation types and their impacts in the Met Office global data assimilation system. The data denial experiments are run over three months using the observations from 15 December 2022 to 15 March 2023 and use a configuration very close to the Met Office operational global numerical weather prediction (NWP) suite, with some exceptions, mainly for reducing the computational cost. The control run uses the complete observing system assimilated operationally at the time, and data from all the main observing systems (e.g., microwave sounders, hyperspectral infrared sounders, clear-sky geostationary sounders, and conventional data, etc.) are denied categorically for a series of experiments. Results indicate that microwave satellite radiance observations continue to be the most important data source overall, being as impactful as conventional observations in the Northern Hemisphere and, along with Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation (GNSS-RO), the most important source in the Tropics and Southern Hemisphere. Conventional observations from aircraft and radiosonde ascents continue to play an essential role, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Our investigation also suggests that GNSS-RO provides significant benefits, especially in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere for key atmospheric variables, especially temperature. Hyperspectral sounders show less impact than in previous studies, though still show strong positive impact in the Southern Hemisphere. Atmospheric motion vectors show impact on tropospheric wind, particularly in the Tropics. In general, all observation types show a positive impact on the mean forecast skill in at least some aspects of the global NWP system.},

  abstract = {The importance of probabilistic weather predictions and climate projections is growing. One of the key elements of the former is stochastic physics, schemes that perturb some uncertain processes in a general circulation model (GCM), such as physical parametrizations or diffusion. They help to increase the ensemble dispersion of ensemble prediction systems (EPS) and in some cases improve certain atmospheric processes by noise‐induced drifts. We have developed a new configuration of stochastic physics schemes for the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM). It consists of an improved Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter v2 (SKEB2), plus the Stochastic Perturbation of Tendencies (SPT).             The improvements to SKEB2 remove spurious physical artefacts, e.g. a spurious wave caused by low‐wave‐number perturbations, and improve the resolution sensitivity of the scheme. The SPT produces a larger ensemble spread in the Tropics than present schemes, but its impact on long‐term climate budgets makes the use of conservation constraints for water vapour and energy essential.             The new configuration produces a higher impact in the Tropics, increasing the ensemble spread and improving some long‐standing climate biases in areas of excessive convection, whilst minimizing the negative impact on tropical processes like tropical convective waves.},

  abstract = {The predictability of high-impact weather events over the North Atlantic is controlled by synoptic-scale systems and the mesoscale structures embedded within them. Despite forecast uncertainty being greatest at small scales at the initial time, forecast error projects strongly onto synoptic and larger scales within days. Different stages of error growth have previously been identified including: convective instability, baroclinic instability and the influence of divergent outflow on the tropopause position, and interactions between disturbances at tropopause level. Evidence is presented for “predictability barriers” (PBs) identified with events on certain validation dates during the North Atlantic Waveguide and Downstream impact Experiment (NAWDEX) where ensemble spread grows more quickly than usual, but ensemble-mean forecast error grows even faster. An advective mechanism for diabatic influence on the development of tropopause ridges is hypothesised to be linked to the PB events. A semi-geostrophic balance tool is used to attribute the response of the 3D ageostrophic flow to geostrophic and diabatic forcing, enabling a novel diagnostic for Diabatically Induced Ageostrophic Advection (DIAA) of potential vorticity. It is shown that predictability barriers are linked to events with strong diabatic influence on tropopause advection during the NAWDEX period. Error growth exceeds ensemble spread rate by approximately 4/3 during strong DIAA events, showing that predictive skill is considerably lower in these situations.},

  abstract = {In 1967, scientists used a simple climate model to predict that human-caused increases in atmospheric CO               2               should warm Earth’s troposphere and cool the stratosphere. This important signature of anthropogenic climate change has been documented in weather balloon and satellite temperature measurements extending from near-surface to the lower stratosphere. Stratospheric cooling has also been confirmed in the mid to upper stratosphere, a layer extending from roughly 25 to 50 km above the Earth’s surface (S               25\>−\>50               ). To date, however, S               25\>−\>50               temperatures have not been used in pattern-based attribution studies of anthropogenic climate change. Here, we perform such a “fingerprint” study with satellite-derived patterns of temperature change that extend from the lower troposphere to the upper stratosphere. Including S               25\>−\>50               information increases signal-to-noise ratios by a factor of five, markedly enhancing fingerprint detectability. Key features of this global-scale human fingerprint include stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming at all latitudes, with stratospheric cooling amplifying with height. In contrast, the dominant modes of internal variability in S               25\>−\>50               have smaller-scale temperature changes and lack uniform sign. These pronounced spatial differences between S               25\>−\>50               signal and noise patterns are accompanied by large cooling of S               25\>−\>50               (1 to 2                                                                                                                                           °                                                                                       C over 1986 to 2022) and low S               25\>−\>50               noise levels. Our results explain why extending “vertical fingerprinting” to the mid to upper stratosphere yields incontrovertible evidence of human effects on the thermal structure of Earth’s atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We review the growing evidence for a widespread inconsistency between the low strength of predictable signals in climate models and the relatively high level of agreement they exhibit with observed variability of the atmospheric circulation. This discrepancy is particularly evident in the climate variability of the Atlantic sector, where ensemble predictions using climate models generally show higher correlation with observed variability than with their own simulations, and higher correlations with observations than would be expected from their small signal-to-noise ratios, hence a ‘signal-to-noise paradox’. This unusual behaviour has been documented in multiple climate prediction systems and in the response to a number of different sources of climate variability. However, we also note that the total variance in the models is often close in magnitude to the observed variance, and so it is not a simple matter of models containing too much variability. Instead, the proportion of Atlantic climate variance that is predictable in climate models appears to be too weak in amplitude by a factor of two, or perhaps more. In this review, we provide a range of examples from existing studies to build the case for a problem that is common across different climate models, common to several different sources of climate variability and common across a range of timescales. We also discuss the wider implications of this intriguing paradox.},

Another field of research is uncovering generic empirical indicators of the proximity to such critical thresholds. Although sudden shifts in complex systems will inevitably continue to surprise us, work at the crossroads of these emerging fields offers new approaches for anticipating critical transitions.},

  abstract = {Significance             Collapse of civilizations remains one of the most enigmatic phenomena in human history. In this paper we provide quantitative evidence that loss of resilience systematically preceded collapses. We take advantage of unique time series documenting both construction activity and climate conditions for pre-Columbian societies of the southwestern United States on an annual basis over a period of eight centuries. These data cover five transformations encompassing shifts to novel constellations of beliefs, social practices, and styles of art and architecture. The remarkable high-resolution time series allowed us to quantify the dynamics of social fragility using numerical techniques for probing resilience. Our results demonstrate that all but one of these transformations happened after decades of rising social instability.           ,              Climate extremes are thought to have triggered large-scale transformations of various ancient societies, but they rarely seem to be the sole cause. It has been hypothesized that slow internal developments often made societies less resilient over time, setting them up for collapse. Here, we provide quantitative evidence for this idea. We use annual-resolution time series of building activity to demonstrate that repeated dramatic transformations of Pueblo cultures in the pre-Hispanic US Southwest were preceded by signals of critical slowing down, a dynamic hallmark of fragility. Declining stability of the status quo is consistent with archaeological evidence for increasing violence and in some cases, increasing wealth inequality toward the end of these periods. Our work thus supports the view that the cumulative impact of gradual processes may make societies more vulnerable through time, elevating the likelihood that a perturbation will trigger a large-scale transformation that includes radically rejecting the status quo and seeking alternative pathways.},

  abstract = {Generations of climate models exhibit biases in their representation of North Atlantic storm tracks, which tend to be too far near the equator and too zonal. Additionally, models have difficulties simulating explosive cyclone growth. These biases are one of the reasons for the uncertainties in projections of future climate over Europe, and the underlying causes have yet to be determined. All three biases are shown to be related, and diabatic processes are pointed to as a likely cause. To demonstrate this, two hemispherically symmetric storm tracks forming downstream of an idealized sea surface temperature (SST) front on an aquaplanet are examined using the seamless ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic weather and climate model (ICON) and its grid refinement capabilities. The analyzed perpetual boreal winter has a global grid spacing of 20 km, two bi-directionally interacting grid nests over the Northern Hemisphere that refine the grid to 10-km spacing over much of the stormtrack and further to 5-km spacing near the SST front. In contrast, no grid refinement is performed for the Southern Hemisphere. Feature-based cyclone tracking shows that the poleward propagation in the NH is enhanced, so the high-resolution storm track is less equatorward and less zonal; explosive deepening rates are more frequent and precipitation rates are amplified. The implication is that resolving diabatic processes on the storm scale improves all three intersecting biases in the representation of storm tracks. While new challenges arise at cloud resolving scales, much improvement for the representation of storm tracks will be gained once climate models resolve the meso-γ scale.},

  abstract = {The influence of extratropical vortices on a global scale is mainly characterised by their size and by the magnitude of their circulation. However, the determination of these properties is still a great challenge since a vortex has no clear delimitations but is part of the flow field itself. In this work, we introduce a kinematic vortex size determination method based on the kinematic vorticity number Wk to atmospheric flows. Wk relates the local rate-of-rotation to the local rate-of-deformation at every point in the field and a vortex core is identified as a simply connected region where the rotation prevails over the deformation. Additionally, considering the sign of vorticity in the extended Wk-method allows to identify highs and lows in different vertical layers of the atmosphere and to study vertical as well as horizontal vortex interactions. We will test the Wk-method in different idealised 2-D (superposition of two lows/low and jet) and real 3-D flow situations (winter storm affecting Europe) and compare the results with traditional methods based on the pressure and the vorticity fields. In comparison to these traditional methods, the Wk-method is able to extract vortex core sizes even in shear-dominated regions that occur frequently in the upper troposphere. Furthermore, statistics of the size and circulation distributions of cyclones will be given. Since the Wk-method identifies vortex cores, the identified radii are subsynoptic with a broad peak around 300Á500 km at the 1000 hPa level. However, the total circulating area is not only restricted to the core. In general, circulations are in the order of 107 m2/s with only a few cyclones in the order of 108 m2/s.},

  abstract = {The classical approach for studying atmospheric variability is based on defining a background state and studying the linear stability of the small fluctuations around such a state. Weakly nonlinear theories can be constructed using higher order expansion terms. While these methods undoubtedly have great value for elucidating the relevant physical processes, they are unable to follow the dynamics of a turbulent atmosphere. We provide a first example of the extension of classical stability analysis to a nonlinearly evolving quasi‐geostrophic flow. The so‐called covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) provide a covariant basis describing the directions of exponential expansion and decay of perturbations to the nonlinear trajectory of the flow. We use such a formalism to re‐examine the basic barotropic and baroclinic processes of the atmosphere with a quasi‐geostrophic beta‐plane two‐layer model in a periodic channel driven by a forced meridional temperature gradient               ΔT               . We explore three settings of               ΔT               , representative of relatively weak turbulence, well‐developed turbulence and intermediate conditions.                                         We construct the Lorenz energy cycle for each CLV describing the energy exchanges with the background state. A positive baroclinic conversion rate is a necessary but not sufficient condition for instability. Barotropic instability is present only for a few very unstable CLVs for large values of               ΔT               . Slowly growing and decaying hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes closely mirror the properties of the background flow. Following the classical necessary conditions for barotropic/baroclinic instability, we find a clear relationship between the properties of the eddy fluxes of a CLV and its instability. CLVs with positive baroclinic conversion seem to form a set of modes for constructing a reduced model of the atmospheric dynamics.},

  abstract = {One of the most relevant weather regimes in the midlatitude atmosphere is the persistent deviation from the approximately zonally symmetric jet stream leading to the emergence of so‐called blocking patterns. Such configurations are usually connected to exceptional local stability properties of the flow which come along with an improved local forecast skills during the phenomenon. It is instead extremely hard to predict onset and decay of blockings. Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs) offer a suitable characterization of the linear stability of a chaotic flow, since they represent the full tangent linear dynamics by a covariant basis which explores linear perturbations at all time scales. Therefore, we assess whether CLVs feature a signature of the blockings. As a first step, we examine the CLVs for a quasi‐geostrophic beta‐plane two‐layer model in a periodic channel baroclinically driven by a meridional temperature gradient               ΔT               . An orographic forcing enhances the emergence of localized blocked regimes. We detect the blocking events of the channel flow with a Tibaldi‐Molteni scheme adapted to the periodic channel. When blocking occurs, the global growth rates of the fastest growing CLVs are significantly higher. Hence, against intuition, the circulation is globally more unstable in blocked phases. Such an increase in the finite time Lyapunov exponents with respect to the long term average is attributed to stronger barotropic and baroclinic conversion in the case of high temperature gradients, while for low values of               ΔT               , the effect is only due to stronger barotropic instability. In order to determine the localization of the CLVs we compare the meridionally averaged variance of the CLVs during blocked and unblocked phases. We find that on average the variance of the CLVs is clustered around the center of blocking. These results show that the blocked flow affects all time scales and processes described by the CLVs.},

While recognized for over a century, the advent of satellite and radar observations, as well as atmospheric-model simulations, has brought about their increased understanding. In this Review, we synthesize current knowledge on MCS formation, climatological characteristics, hazardous weather, predictive capacity and projected changes with anthropogenic warming. Driven by typical deep moist convective processes (moisture, lift and instability) and vertical wind shear, MCS formation occurs preferentially in locations where these ingredients are present and can be maintained by large-scale ascent and the cold pools that they produce. MCSs also generate hazardous weather, including extreme rainfall, flooding, derechos and, sometimes, tornadoes and hail, all of which have substantial economic and societal impacts. Given that MCSs also produce a large fraction of warm-season rainfall, there is critical need for both short-term forecasts and long-term projections, presently challenged by inadequate model resolution. Yet, with continually improving modelling capabilities, as well as greater theoretical basis, it is suggested that MCSs might increase in frequency and intensity under a warming climate. Further modelling progress, in turn, offers improved understanding of MCS characteristics, from their life cycle through to impacts.},

The stochastic convection scheme has been shown to introduce an appropriate amount of variability onto the model grid without the need to resolve the convection explicitly. This largely reduces computational costs and enables a set of 12 cases equally distributed over 1 year with five ensemble members for each case, generated by the stochastic convection scheme. As a metric, difference kinetic energy at 300 hPa over the midlatitudes, both north and south, is used. With this metric the intrinsic limit is estimated to be about 17 days when a threshold of 80\% of the saturation level is applied. The error level at 3.5 days roughly compares to the initial-condition uncertainty of the current ECMWF data assimilation system, which suggests a potential improvement of 3.5 forecast days through perfecting the initial conditions. Error-growth experiments that use a deterministic convection scheme show smaller errors of about half the size at early forecast times and an estimate of intrinsic predictability that is about 10\% longer, confirming the overconfidence of deterministic convection schemes.},

For this purpose, estimates of the current initial condition uncertainty of 12 real cases are reduced in several steps from 100\% to 0.1\% and propagated in time with a global numerical weather prediction model (ICON at 40 km resolution) that is extended by a stochastic convection scheme to better represent error growth from unresolved motions. With the provision that the perfect model assumption is sufficiently valid, it is found that the potential forecast improvement that could be obtained by perfecting the initial conditions is 4–5 days. This improvement is essentially achieved with an initial condition uncertainty reduction by 90\% relative to current conditions, at which point the dominant error growth mechanism changes: With respect to physical processes, a transition occurs from rotationally driven initial error growth to error growth dominated by latent heat release in convection and due to the divergent component of the flow. With respect to spatial scales, a transition from large-scale up-amplitude error growth to a very rapid initial error growth on small scales is found. Reference experiments with a deterministic convection scheme show a 5\%–10\% longer predictability, but only if the initial condition uncertainty is small. These results confirm that planetary-scale predictability is intrinsically limited by rapid error growth due to latent heat release in clouds through an upscale-interaction process, while this interaction process is unimportant on average for current levels of initial condition uncertainty.},

The initial growth was confined to precipitating regions, with a faster growth rate where conditional instability was large. Growth in these regions saturated within 3–10 h, continuing for the longest where the precipitation rate was large.

They often exhibit a north-south component or waviness connected to extreme weather at the surface. Recently the upper-level eastward jet stream was found to exhibit a fast-get-faster response under climate change explained by the impact of the nonlinear Clausius-Clapeyron relation on the latitudinal density contrast. Here we show the fast-get-faster mechanism also applies to the upper-level north-south jet stream wind and the longitudinal density contrast, implying increased waviness under climate change. Arctic Sea ice loss, which has been proposed as a driver of increased waviness, cannot explain the response. It leads to a fast-get-slower waviness response at all vertical levels. We demonstrate the fast-get-faster waviness signal has emerged in reanalysis data in the Southern Hemisphere but not yet in the Northern Hemisphere. The results show the fast-get-faster mechanism explains upper-level waviness changes and highlights a tug of war between upper- and mid-level waviness under climate change.},

Since scholars, institutions, and publishers alike all have strong interests in affiliating with high JIF journals, strategic behaviors to ‘game’ the JIF metric are prevalent. Strategic self-citation is a common tactic employed to inflate JIF values. Based on empirical analyses of academic journals indexed in the Web of Science, we examine institutional characteristics conducive to strategic self-citation for JIF inflation. Journals disseminated by for-profit publishers, with lower JIFs, published in academically peripheral countries and with more recent founding dates were more likely to exhibit JIF-inflating self-citation patterns. Findings reveal the importance of status and institutional logics in influencing metrics gaming behaviors, as well as how metrics can affect work outcomes in different types of institutions.

This is due to specifying background error covariances for the data assimilation that were inappropriate prior to availability during 2006 of GNSS radio occultation data in sufficient numbers to constrain a cold bias of the assimilating ERA5 model. A new set of analyses, termed ERA5.1, has thus been produced for the period from 2000 to 2006 using the background error covariances that were used to produce the ERA5 analyses for the years 1979 to 1999. ERA5.1 also includes the more restrictive ensemble assimilation of SBUV ozone data that was used in production of ERA5 for 1979 to 1999.¡/p¿ ¡p¿ ERA5.1 provides analyses with better global-mean temperatures in the stratosphere and uppermost troposphere than provided by ERA5. ERA5.1 stands up well in comparison with ERA-Interim and other reanalyses in the lower stratosphere, although there are also lower-stratospheric temperature differences between ERA5 and other reanalyses in the 1980s and 1990s. These are due in part to differences in radiosonde temperature bias adjustment. The pronounced near-tropopause cold bias of ERA5 from 2000 to 2006 has implications for the representation of stratospheric humidity, for which ERA5.1 performs better, though by no means perfectly. ERA5.1 does not exhibit the spuriously high values of ozone that occur close to the South Pole in the polar nights of 2003 and 2004 in the ERA5 analyses. Synoptic evolution in the extratropical stratosphere is seen to be very similar in two cases involving splitting of the stratospheric polar vortex and secondary vortex formation by dynamical instability.

The ERA5 product from 1979 to end 2020 and a preliminary back extension from 1950 to 1978 have already been described elsewhere. The new back extension that spans 1940 to 1978 represents the official release and supersedes the preliminary product. Currently, the ERA5 data record extends over more than 83\,years of hourly global three‐dimensional fields for many quantities that describe the global atmosphere, land surface, and ocean waves at a horizontal resolution of about 31\,km. ERA5 relies on the ingestion of sub‐daily in‐situ and satellite observations, and the number of these increases from 17,000 per day in 1940 to 25~million per day by 2022. Accordingly, the quality of the reanalysis improves throughout the period. Over the Northern Hemisphere ERA5 generally provides a reliable representation of the synoptic situation from the early 1940s and provides long‐term variability that is in line with other datasets. Over the Southern Hemisphere, however, for the early period the description of ERA5 seems mainly statistical. Furthermore, there is a small deviation in surface temperature compared with reconstructions based on monthly aggregations of observations over land before 1946. For this period, the absence of upper air temperature observations reveals a model cold bias in the lower stratosphere. For the period from 1950 to 1978, the final release described here improves on the suboptimal treatment of International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship observations in the preliminary release, with, as a result, a much more homogeneous representation of tropical cyclones over the entire ERA5 record. Longer spin‐up periods also have a beneficial impact on soil moisture.},

Using a Lagrangian moisture source diagnostic and data from the ERA‐40: European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis, the contribution of the following moisture sources to annual mean precipitation has been diagnosed: North Atlantic ocean 39.6\%, Mediterranean 23.3\%, North Sea and Baltic Sea 16.6\%, and European land surface 20.8\%. However, strong seasonal variability of the influence of various moisture sources is evident. Most notably, moisture transport to the Alps changes from an oceanic mode characterised by dominantly North Atlantic moisture sources during winter to a continental mode during summer with a marked contribution from Central European land areas. The method identifies inter‐annual variability with respect to the location of the moisture sources in the North Atlantic, and the importance of precipitation recycling during summer. Despite the smoothed Alpine orography in the ERA‐40 model, the Alps act as an effective barrier for meridional moisture transport, leading to distinct mean moisture source locations at their northern and southern slopes. The Northern Alps are predominantly influenced by the North Atlantic ocean and Central European land sources with a clear seasonality and limited monthly variability. In contrast, the Southern Alps receive a large fraction of precipitation from the Mediterranean with considerable month‐to‐month variability. Possible implications of these differences for precipitation extremes and stable isotopes in precipitation are discussed. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

Even if these two state‐of‐the‐art systems frequently assimilate all available measurements for one, or assimilate radar data every 30~s for the other, considerable uncertainty remains in unobserved atmospheric properties such as temperature or humidity. Worse, limited improvement can be expected as limited direct measurements exist, and essentially all the covariance‐based information is being exploited. Unless a massive investment in new measurement technologies occurs, or radically new ideas are proposed, forecast accuracy will remain insufficient to properly simulate the complete lifetime of a thunderstorm, limiting the accuracy and value of threat forecasting.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Because thunderstorms evolve quickly and generate many threats, a large research community seeks to improve their forecasts. But progress is difficult. To understand why, we studied the quality of the forecasts from two research‐quality systems. We found that we have a considerable challenge in estimating the detailed structure of temperature, humidity, and winds in the atmosphere in and around storms. This then hampers how far in the future we can forecast the evolution of storms and their threats. Our analysis also suggests that we are doing as well as our current measurements and tools allow. Hence, without significantly changing them, progress will remain difficult.           ,              Key Points                                                                Initial conditions derived using two of the best convective‐scale data assimilation systems have considerable errors at storm‐cell scales                                                     These errors severely limit the skillful forecast time of thunderstorms and their threats                                                     A greater variety in observational data sets at higher density would reduce errors at smaller scales},

Here we investigate the flow‐dependence of this uncertainty during Boreal winter. We categorize the large‐scale flow using North Atlantic‐European weather regimes. First, we show that forecast uncertainty of near‐surface geopotential height (Z1000) and temperature (T2m) are strongly sensitive to the prevailing regime. Specifically, forecast uncertainty of Z1000 reduces over northern Europe following Greenland Blocking (enhanced predictability) due to a southward shifting eddy‐driven jet. However, due to strong temperature gradients and variable flow patterns, Greenland blocking is linked to increased forecast uncertainty of T2m over Europe (reduced predictability). Second, we show that forecast uncertainty of weather regimes is modulated via the stratospheric polar vortex. Weak polar vortex states tend to reduce regimeuncertainty, for example, due to more frequent predicted occurrence of Greenland blocking. These regime changes are associated with increased T2m uncertainty over Europe.},

  abstract = {Lagrangian trajectories are widely used in the atmospheric sciences, for instance to identify flow structures in extratropical cyclones (e.g., warm conveyor belts) and long-range transport pathways of moisture and trace substances. Here a new version of the Lagrangian analysis tool LAGRANTO (Wernli and Davies, 1997) is introduced, which offers considerably enhanced functionalities. Trajectory starting positions can be defined easily and flexibly based on different geometrical and/or meteorological conditions, e.g., equidistantly spaced within a prescribed region and on a stack of pressure (or isentropic) levels. After the computation of the trajectories, a versatile selection of trajectories is offered based on single or combined criteria. These criteria are passed to LAGRANTO with a simple command language (e.g., “GT:PV:2” readily translates into a selection of all trajectories with potential vorticity, PV, greater than 2 PVU; 1 PVU = 10−6 K m2 kg−1 s−1). Full versions of this new version of LAGRANTO are available for global ECMWF and regional COSMO data, and core functionality is provided for the regional WRF and MetUM models and the global 20th Century Reanalysis data set. The paper first presents the intuitive application of LAGRANTO for the identification of a warm conveyor belt in the North Atlantic. A further case study then shows how LAGRANTO can be used to quasi-operationally diagnose stratosphere–troposphere exchange events. Whereas these examples rely on the ECMWF version, the COSMO version and input fields with 7 km horizontal resolution serve to resolve the rather complex flow structure associated with orographic blocking due to the Alps, as shown in a third example. A final example illustrates the tool’s application in source–receptor analysis studies. The new distribution of LAGRANTO is publicly available and includes auxiliary tools, e.g., to visualize trajectories. A detailed user guide describes all LAGRANTO capabilities.},

Here we track blocks as upper-level negative potential vorticity (PV) anomalies and apply a Lagrangian analysis to 100\,years of present-day (∼2000) and future (∼2100, under the RCP8.5 scenario) climate simulations restarted from the Community Earth System Model–Large Ensemble Project runs (CESM-LENS) to identify different physical processes and quantify how their relative importance changes in a warmer and more humid climate. The trajectories reveal two contrasting airstreams that both contribute to the formation and maintenance of blocking: latent heating in strongly ascending airstreams (moist processes) and quasi-adiabatic flow near the tropopause with weak radiative cooling (dry processes). Both are reproduced remarkably well when compared against ERA-Interim reanalysis, and their relative importance varies regionally and seasonally. The response of blocks to climate change is complex and differs regionally, with a general increase in the importance of moist processes due to stronger latent heating (+1\,K in the median over the Northern Hemisphere) and a larger fraction (+15\%) of strongly heated warm conveyor belt air masses, most pronounced over the storm tracks. Future blocks become larger (+7\%) and their negative PV anomaly slightly intensifies (+0.8\%). Using a Theil–Sen regression model, we propose that the increase in size and intensity is related to the increase in latent heating, resulting in stronger cross-isentropic transport of air with low PV into the blocking anticyclones. Our findings provide evidence that moist processes become more important for the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the midlatitudes, with the potential for larger and more intense blocks.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric blocking represents an important aspect of the mid-latitude weather variability, but the different processes contributing to its formation and maintenance are not yet fully understood. This study investigates the role that diabatic processes, in particular the release of latent heating in strongly ascending airstreams, play in the dynamics and spatio-temporal variability of blocking in a detailed 38-year global climatological analysis. The results show that the formation and (re-) intensification of blocking are often preceded by latent heating connected to upstream baroclinic developments. While the importance of latent heating varies considerably between individual blocking events and different regions, in particular between ocean and continents, latent heating is generally most important during onset and in more intense and larger blocks. The episodic nature of latent heating during the blocking life cycle, associated with a series of transient cyclones approaching the blocking, can contribute to both the high- (fast onset and fluctuation in intensity and size) and low-frequency (maintenance and quasi-stationarity during maturation phase) properties of blocking anticyclones and provide the required flow amplification in addition to dry-dynamical interaction between synoptic eddies and blocking. This amplification results from a combination of the direct injection of anticyclonic air into the upper-troposphere within cross-isentropic ascending airstreams, setting up large-scale anticyclonic PV anomalies, and the advection of PV by the enhanced divergent outflow at the tropopause (indirect effect). This divergent outflow on the western flank of the blocking anticyclone interacts with the upper-level PV gradient and leads to a westward amplification of the ridge, diminishing the tendency for dissipation and the eastward advection by the background flow, thus contributing to blocking stationarity. Taking into account such diabatic mechanisms in blocking dynamics will be important to improve predictions of blocking and assess future changes in the extratropical large-scale circulation.},

  abstract = {The formation of persistent anticyclonic circulation anomalies, denoted as atmospheric blocking, represents an important aspect of mid-latitude weather variability. These circulation anomalies disrupt or block the prevailing westerly flow and the eastward progression of synoptic eddies, often causing anomalous, sometimes extreme weather. In spite of the importance of atmospheric blocking for weather and climate, the blocking mechanism is not yet fully understood, and accurately simulating the formation and duration of blocks is a challenge for numerical weather forecasting and climate models. Theories about blocking are based on dry dynamics, describing the dry-adiabatic interactions between transient baroclinic waves and the large-scale diffluent flow, during which air masses with low potential vorticity (PV) are advected poleward, setting up an intense anticyclonic PV anomaly. While moist diabatic processes, and in particular latent heating (LH) due to cloud formation in ascending airstreams, are known to play a significant role in modifying the upper-level large-scale flow, they have been far less considered in theories about blocking. The aim of this thesis is to better understand the role of LH in atmospheric blocking dynam- ics. This goal is addressed with three different approaches: (i) climatological investigations of diabatic contributions to atmospheric blocking using reanalysis, (ii) detailed model-based sensitivity experiments to study the causal relationship and sensitivity of blocking to changes in LH, and (iii) evaluation of climate simulations and the assessment of projected future changes. To this end, trajectory-based diagnostics along with a combination of statistical analyses are applied to different data sets (reanalysis, weather and climate model output), making extensive use of the PV perspective. The first part of the thesis describes a comprehensive global climatology of blocking and LH along kinematic 7-day backward trajectories from the upper-level low-PV regions, using the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset between 1979 and 2016. The feature-based climatological analy- sis, based on 4270 blocking events and ∼30 million trajectories, reveals that the flow associated with blocking is actually never perfectly adiabatic. Between 31 - 46 \% of all blocking air masses have been heated by more than 2 K, with a median heating of 8.5 K, during the final 3 days before entering the blocking anticyclone, and this number increases to 58 - 67 \% (12.5 K in the median) when considering a 7-day period. The other blocking air masses, which enter the block with the upper-level jet stream, have been mostly cooled by a median −4 K in 3 days. While the importance of LH varies considerably between individual blocking events and different regions, in particular between ocean and continents, LH is generally most important during blocking onset and (re-)intensification and in more intense and larger blocks. LH is often con- nected to upstream baroclinic developments in the mid-latitude storm tracks and provides the required flow amplification in addition to dry-dynamical interaction between synoptic eddies and blocking, thereby contributing to both the high- (fast onset and fluctuation in intensity and size) and low-frequency (maintenance and quasi-stationarity during maturation phase) properties of blocking anticyclones. This amplification of the upper-level circulation by LH is due to a combination of two effects: the direct injection of air masses with low PV into the upper troposphere in strongly ascending ‘warm conveyor belt’ (WCB) airstreams, and the indirect effect owing to the interaction of the associated divergent outflow with the upper-level PV structure. Both effects act to slow down eastward propagation and amplify the intensity of the block. The second part of the thesis explicitly explores the causal effect of LH on the development of five different blocking cases. Numerical sensitivity experiments are performed with the global weather prediction model IFS in which LH is artificially altered in clouds upstream of the blocks. The elimination of LH has substantial effects on the vertical motion and upper-tropospheric circulation in all case studies, but there is also significant case-to-case variability: some blocking systems do not develop at all without upstream LH, while for others the amplitude of the blocking anticyclone is merely reduced. This sensitivity is related to the state of the background flow. The presence of a large-scale diffluent flow supports the meridional amplification of synoptic-scale Rossby waves also in the absence of LH. These sensitivity experiments demon- strate the complex two-way interaction between moist diabatic and dry baroclinic processes, and the vital role of LH in the formation and maintenance of blocking. The last part of the thesis presents a systematic and quantitative investigation of the influence of LH on blocking in a warmer and moister climate as projected for the end of the 21th century in CESM-LE large ensemble climate simulations. Blocking and diabatic processes are reasonably well represented in the present-day reference simulations (1990–2000), although blocking fre- quencies are underestimated over both the Pacific and Euro-Atlantic sectors when compared to ERA-Interim. In future climate (2091–2100) under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, the responses of blocking to global warming are projected to be weak with a complex regional and seasonal variation. There is substantial uncertainty in many regions concerning the sign of the change. This is related to the fact that changes in blocking frequencies are influenced by the combined effect of future changes in the jet stream, cyclone activity and diabatic heating. Nevertheless, a robust conclusion is that the increase in temperature and hence moisture in the atmosphere leads to an increase in the importance of LH. This can mainly be attributed to a 50 \% increase in WCB airmasses with strong diabatic heating, which can initiate Rossby wave amplification and breaking along a stronger future jet stream. However, it is still unclear how enhanced LH will affect blocking intensity and duration. In conclusion, moist diabatic processes, in particular the release of latent heat in ascending airstreams, are of first-order importance for the formation of prolonged circulation anomalies related to atmospheric blocking. Such moist diabatic processes thus have to be taken into account to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of blocking dynamics.},

  abstract = {Nowadays color in scientific visualizations is standard and extensively used to group, highlight or delineate different parts of data in visualizations. The rainbow color map (also known as jet color map) is famous for its appealing use of the full visual spectrum with impressive changes in chroma and luminance. Besides attracting attention, science has for decades criticized the rainbow color map for its nonlinear and erratic change of hue and luminance along the data variation. The missed uniformity causes a misrepresentation of data values and flaws in science communication. The rainbow color map is scientifically incorrect and hardly decodable for a considerable number of people due to color vision deficiency (CVD) or other vision impairments. Here we aim to raise awareness of how widely used the rainbow color map still is in hydrology. To this end, we perform a paper survey scanning for color issues in around 1000 scientific publications in three different journals including papers published between 2005 and 2020. In this survey, depending on the journal, 16 \%–24 \% of the publications have a rainbow color map and around the same ratio of papers (18 \%–29 \%) uses red–green elements often in a way that color is the only possibility to decode the visualized groups of data. Given these shares, there is a 99.6 \% chance to pick at least one visual problematic publication in 10 randomly chosen papers from our survey. To overcome the use of the rainbow color maps in science, we propose some tools and techniques focusing on improvement of typical visualization types in hydrological science. We give guidance on how to avoid, improve and trust color in a proper and scientific way. Finally, we outline an approach how the rainbow color map flaws should be communicated across different status groups in science.},

  abstract = {Precipitation is a key climate variable that affects large parts of society, especially in situations with excess amounts. Climate change projections show an intensified hydrological cycle through changes in intensity, frequency, and duration of precipitation events. Still, due to the complexity of precipitation processes and their large variability in time and space, climate models struggle to represent precipitation accurately. This study investigates the simulated precipitation in Europe in available climate model ensembles that cover a range of horizontal model resolutions. The ensembles used are global climate models (GCMs) from CMIP5 and CMIP6 (∼ 100–300 km horizontal grid spacing at mid-latitudes), GCMs from the PRIMAVERA project at sparse (∼ 80–160 km) and dense (∼ 25–50 km) grid spacing, and CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs) at sparse (∼ 50 km) and dense (∼ 12.5 km) grid spacing. The aim is to seasonally and regionally over Europe investigate the differences between models and model ensembles in the representation of the precipitation distribution in its entirety and through analysis of selected standard precipitation indices. In addition, the model ensemble performances are compared to gridded observations from E-OBS.},

Here, following recent work by Schemm et~al., we leverage a large multimodel ensemble to show that a coupled model’s ability to simulate extreme Gulf Stream precipitation is tightly linked to its simulated frequency of European blocking and northern jet excursions. Furthermore, the reduced biases in blocking and jet variability are consistent with better resolved precipitation extrema in high-resolution models. The analysis supports a hypothesis that models which simulate more extreme precipitation can generate more strongly poleward-propagating cyclones and more intense anticyclonic anomalies due to the stronger latent heat release occurring during extreme events. By contrast, typical North Atlantic SST biases are found to share only a weak or negligible relationship with blocking and jet biases. Finally, while previous studies have used a comparison between coupled models and models run with prescribed SSTs to argue for the role of ocean resolution, we emphasize here that models run with prescribed SSTs experience greatly reduced precipitation extremes due to their excessive thermal damping, making it unclear if such a comparison is meaningful. Instead, we speculate that most of the reduction in coupled model biases may actually be due to increased atmospheric resolution leading to better resolved convection.},

These form the basis for a probabilistic Earth system model in atmosphere-only mode. Stochastic parametrization have become standard in several operational weather-forecasting models, in particular due to their beneficial impact on model spread. In recent years, stochastic schemes in the atmospheric component of a model have been shown to improve aspects important for the models long-term climate, such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic weather regimes, and the Indian monsoon. Stochasticity in the land component has been shown to improve the variability of soil processes and improve the representation of heatwaves over Europe. However, the raw impact of such schemes on the model mean is less well studied. It is shown that the inclusion of all three schemes notably changes the model mean state. While many of the impacts are beneficial, some are too large in amplitude, leading to significant changes in the model’s energy budget and atmospheric circulation. This implies that in order to maintain the benefits of stochastic physics without shifting the mean state too far from observations, a full re-tuning of the model will typically be required.},

We analyse both the skill and signal‐to‐noise ratio using a new statistical toy model, which assumes NAO predictability is driven by regime dynamics. It is shown that if the system is approximately bimodal in nature, with the model consistently underestimating the level of regime persistence each season, then both the high skill and high RPC value of the Met Office hindcasts can easily be reproduced. Underestimation of regime persistence could be attributable to any number of sources of model error, including imperfect regime structure or errors in the propagation of teleconnections. In particular, a high RPC value for a seasonal mean prediction may be expected even if the model's internal level of noise is realistic.},

Their existence and behaviour has been extensively studied in meteorology and climate science, due to their potential for drastically simplifying the complex and chaotic mid-latitude dynamics. Several well-known, simple non-linear dynamical systems have been used as toy-models of the atmosphere in order to understand and exemplify such regime behaviour. Nevertheless, no agreed-upon and clear-cut definition of a ‘regime’ exists in the literature, and unambiguously detecting their existence in the atmospheric circulation is stymied by the high dimensionality of the system. We argue here for an approach which equates the existence of regimes in a dynamical system with the existence of non-trivial topological structure of the system’s attractor. We show using persistent homology, an algorithmic tool in topological data analysis, that this approach is computationally tractable, practically informative, and identifies the relevant regime structure across a range of examples.},

  abstract = {Uncertainties in parametrized processes in general circulation models can be represented as stochastic perturbations to the model formulation. The European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has pioneered approaches to represent these model errors in forecasting systems. In particular, the stochastically perturbed physical tendency (SPPT) scheme for the atmosphere is used in their operational ensemble system for medium‐ and long‐range predictions. Recent studies have shown that these stochastic approaches can both increase the reliability of the probabilistic forecasts and reduce long‐term mean biases of the model climate. Towards developing a seamless prediction system in the future, these benefits of stochastic parametrization for both short‐term and long‐term forecasts make it an essential component of the next generation Earth System models. We present results of the impact of different configurations of the SPPT scheme in ECMWF's seasonal forecasting System 4 on the mean and variability in tropical precipitation. Small‐scale perturbations in the SPPT scheme play a significant role in reducing the mean biases in tropical precipitation. The stochastic physics also nonlinearly rectify the convection and precipitation during different phases of El Niño Southern Oscillation events and improve the reliability of the ensemble forecasts for the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). They impact the MJO dynamics by modulating the convective and suppressed phases of the MJO. Finally, we discuss some of the caveats to this analysis and some future prospects.},

In this paper, we use a hemispheric barotropic model together with estimates of transfer operators on a reduced phase space to develop an early warning indicator of the zonal to blocked flow transition in this model. It is shown that the spectrum of the transfer operators can be used to study the slow dynamics of the flow as well as the non-Markovian character of the reduction. The slowest motions are thereby found to have time scales of three to six weeks and to be associated with meta-stable regimes (and their transitions) which can be detected as almost-invariant sets of the transfer operator. From the energy budget of the model, we are able to explain the meta-stability of the regimes and the existence of preferred transition paths. Even though the model is highly simplified, the skill of the early warning indicator is promising, suggesting that the transfer operator approach can be used in parallel to an operational deterministic model for stochastic prediction or to assess forecast uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Significant surface air temperature warming during summer 1979–2020 is not uniformly distributed in the northern midlatitudes over land but rather is confined to several longitudinal sectors including Europe, central Siberia and Mongolia, and both coasts of North America. These hot spots are accompanied by a chain of high pressure ridges from an anomalous, circumglobal Rossby wave train in the upper troposphere. From reanalysis data and several baseline experiments from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), we find that the circulation trend pattern is associated with fluctuations of the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation. The phase shift of AMV in the 1990s is particularly noteworthy for accelerating warming averaged over the northern midlatitude land. The amplitude of the observed trend in both surface air temperature and the upper-level geopotential height generally falls beyond the range of multidecadal trends simulated by the CMIP6 preindustrial control runs, supporting the likelihood that anthropogenic forcing played a critical role in the observed trend. On the other hand, the fidelity of the simulated low-frequency modes of variability and their teleconnections, especially on multidecadal time scales, is difficult to assess because of the relatively short observational records. Our mechanistic modeling results indicate that synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction is a key to the formation of the anomalous wave train but how the multidecadal modes can modulate the synoptic eddies through atmosphere–ocean and atmosphere–land interactions remains poorly understood. This gap in our knowledge makes it challenging to quantify the roles of the low-frequency modes and external forcings in causing the observed multidecadal trends.},

The study is performed on 500 hPa geopotential height and on Euro-Atlantic and Pacific blocking separately. It is found that blocking frequency is severely underestimated in medium-range forecasts; the model is, on average, reasonably skilful if the initial conditions are blocked, but blocking onset is poorly represented if it occurs more than a few days into the forecast. This inability in entering the blocking regime has a substantial impact on the systematic error of the model.},

The National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research gridded reanalyses were used to make each of these calculations. The block intensification period for each event was associated with a deepening surface cyclone during a 48-h period beginning at 1200 UTC 28 July and 1200 UTC 8 August 1986, respectively. These results demonstrate that the diabatic heating forces height rises through the sensible and latent heating terms in these two Southern Hemisphere blocking events. The sensible heating was the larger contributor, second only to (about the same as) the vorticity advection term in the first (second) event. The vorticity advection term has been shown by several studies to be associated with block intensification.},

We use ERA-Interim reanalysis data and COBE sea ice and sea surface temperature observational data to trace the dynamical pathways that caused these extreme phenomena. Following abnormally low sea ice conditions in early autumn over the Pacific sector of the Arctic basin, blocking anticyclones became dominant over Eurasia throughout autumn. Ural blocking (UB) activity was four times above climatological levels and organized in several successive events. UB episodes played a key role in the unprecedented sea ice loss observed in late autumn 2016 over the Barents-Kara Seas and the weakening of the stratospheric vortex. Each blocking induced circulation anomalies that resulted in cold air advection to its south and warm advection to its north. The near-surface warming anomalies over the Arctic and cooling anomalies over midlatitude Eurasia varied in phase with the life cycles of UB episodes. The sea ice cover minimum over the Barents-Kara Seas in 2016 was not observed in late summer but rather in mid-November and December shortly after the two strongest UB episodes. Each UB episode drove intense upward flux of wave activity that resulted in unseasonable weakening of the stratospheric vortex in November. The surface impact of this weakening can be linked to the migration of blocking activity and cold spells toward Europe in early winter 2017.},

We show that the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) simulations project coherent regional patterns in meteorological drought for two emissions scenarios to 2100. We find robust projected changes in seasonal drought duration and frequency (robust over {$>$}45\% of the global land area), despite a lack of agreement across models in projected changes in mean precipitation (24\% of the land area). Future drought changes are larger and more consistent in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5. We find regionalized increases and decreases in drought duration and frequency that are driven by changes in both precipitation mean and variability. Conversely, drought intensity increases over most regions but is not simulated well historically by the climate models. The more robust projections of meteorological drought compared to mean precipitation in CMIP6 provides significant new opportunities for water resource planning. Plain Language Summary Understanding how climate change affects droughts guides adaptation planning in agriculture, water security, and ecosystem management. Earlier climate projections have highlighted high uncertainty in future drought projections, hindering effective planning. We use the latest projections and find more robust projections of meteorological drought compared to mean precipitation. These more robust projections provide clearer direction for water resource planning and the identification of agricultural and natural ecosystems at risk.},

In this review, these quantifiers computed in a hierarchy of atmospheric models (coupled or not to an ocean) are analyzed, together with their local counterparts known as the local or finite-time Lyapunov exponents. It is shown in particular that the variability of the local Lyapunov exponents (corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov exponent) decreases when the model resolution increases. The dynamics of (finite-amplitude) initial condition errors in these models is also reviewed, and in general found to display a complicated growth far from the asymptotic estimates provided by the Lyapunov exponents. The implications of these results for operational (high resolution) atmospheric and climate modelling are also discussed.},

Although AMOC collapses have been induced in complex global climate models by strong freshwater forcing, the processes of an AMOC tipping event have so far not been investigated. Here, we show results of the first tipping event in the Community Earth System Model, including the large climate impacts of the collapse. Using these results, we develop a physics-based and observable early warning signal of AMOC tipping: the minimum of the AMOC-induced freshwater transport at the southern boundary of the Atlantic. Reanalysis products indicate that the present-day AMOC is on route to tipping. The early warning signal is a useful alternative to classical statistical ones, which, when applied to our simulated tipping event, turn out to be sensitive to the analyzed time interval before tipping.           ,              A complex global climate model shows an AMOC tipping event.},

In a first step, the needed underlying dynamical models are derived from data using a non-parametric model-based clustering framework. The covariant Lyapunov vectors are then approximated based on these data-driven models. The data-based numerical approach is tested using three well-understood example systems with increasing dynamical complexity, identifying properties that allow for a successful application of the method: in particular, the method is identified to require a clear multiple time scale structure with fast transitions between slow subsystems. The latter slow dynamics should be dynamically characterized by invariant neutral directions of the linear approximation model.},

Urban effects on temperature and precipitation have drawn considerable attention. These associated physical processes are also closely linked to clouds’ formation and dynamics. Cloud is one of the critical components in regulating urban hydrometeorological cycles but remains less understood in urban-atmospheric systems. We analyzed satellite-derived cloud patterns spanning two decades over 447 US cities and quantified the urban-influenced cloud patterns diurnally and seasonally. The systematic assessment suggests that most cities experience enhanced daytime cloud cover in both summer and winter; nocturnal cloud enhancement prevails in summer by 5.8\%, while there is modest cloud suppression in winter nights. Statistically linking the cloud patterns with city properties, geographic locations, and climate backgrounds, we found that larger city size and stronger surface heating are primarily responsible for summer local cloud enhancement diurnally. Moisture and energy background control the urban cloud cover anomalies seasonally. Under strong mesoscale circulations induced by terrains and land–water contrasts, urban clouds exhibit considerable nighttime enhancement during warm seasons, which is relevant to strong urban surface heating interacting with these circulations, but other local and climate impacts remain complicated and inconclusive. Our research unveils extensive urban influences on local cloud patterns, but the effects are diverse depending on time, location, and city properties. The comprehensive observational study on urban–cloud interactions calls for more in-depth research on urban cloud life cycles and their radiative and hydrologic implications under the urban warming context.},

In this article, we introduce the Easy Uncertainty Quantification (EasyUQ) technique, which transforms real-valued model output into calibrated statistical distributions, based solely on training data of model output--outcome pairs, without any need to access model input. In its basic form, EasyUQ is a special case of the recently introduced isotonic distributional regression (IDR) technique that leverages the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm for nonparametric isotonic regression. EasyUQ yields discrete predictive distributions that are calibrated and optimal in finite samples, subject to stochastic monotonicity. The workflow is fully automated, without any need for tuning. The Smooth EasyUQ approach supplements IDR with kernel smoothing, to yield continuous predictive distributions that preserve key properties of the basic form, including both stochastic monotonicity with respect to the original model output and asymptotic consistency. For the selection of kernel parameters, we introduce multiple one-fit grid search, a computationally much less demanding approximation to leave-one-out cross-validation. We use simulation examples and forecast data from weather prediction to illustrate the techniques. In a study of benchmark problems from machine learning, we show how EasyUQ and Smooth EasyUQ can be integrated into the workflow of neural network learning and hyperparameter tuning, and we find EasyUQ to be competitive with conformal prediction as well as more elaborate input-based approaches.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models struggle to skillfully predict tropical precipitation occurrence and amount, calling for alternative approaches. For instance, it has been shown that fairly simple, purely data-driven logistic regression models for 24-h precipitation occurrence outperform both climatological and NWP forecasts for the West African summer monsoon. More complex neural network–based approaches, however, remain underdeveloped due to the non-Gaussian character of precipitation. In this study, we develop, apply, and evaluate a novel two-stage approach, where we train a U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) model on gridded rainfall data to obtain a deterministic forecast and then apply the recently developed, nonparametric Easy Uncertainty Quantification (EasyUQ) approach to convert it into a probabilistic forecast. We evaluate CNN+EasyUQ for 1-day-ahead 24-h accumulated precipitation forecasts over northern tropical Africa for 2011–19, with the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) data serving as ground truth. In the most comprehensive assessment to date, we compare CNN+EasyUQ to state-of-the-art physics-based and data-driven approaches such as monthly probabilistic climatology, raw and postprocessed ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and traditional statistical approaches that use up to 25 predictor variables from IMERG and the ERA5 reanalysis. Generally, statistical approaches perform about on par with postprocessed ECMWF ensemble forecasts. The CNN+EasyUQ approach, however, clearly outperforms all competitors in terms of both occurrence and amount. Hybrid methods that merge CNN+EasyUQ and physics-based forecasts show slight further improvement. Thus, the CNN+EasyUQ approach can likely improve operational probabilistic forecasts of rainfall in the tropics and potentially even beyond.                            Significance Statement               Precipitation forecasts in the tropics remain a great challenge despite their enormous potential to create socioeconomic benefits in sectors such as food and energy production. Here, we develop a purely data-driven, machine learning–based prediction model that outperforms traditional, physics-based approaches to 1-day-ahead forecasts of rainfall occurrence and rainfall amount over northern tropical Africa in terms of both forecast skill and computational costs. A combined data-driven and physics-based (hybrid) approach yields further (slight) improvement in terms of forecast skill. These results suggest new avenues to more accurate and more resource-efficient operational precipitation forecasts in the Global South.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) associated with extratropical cyclones transport air from the lower troposphere into the tropopause region and contribute to upper-level ridge building and the formation of blocking anticyclones. Recent studies indicate that this constitutes an important source and magnifier of forecast uncertainty and errors in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. However, a systematic evaluation of the representation of WCBs in NWP models has yet to be determined. Here, we employ the logistic regression models developed in Part I to identify the inflow, ascent, and outflow stages of WCBs in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) subseasonal reforecasts for Northern Hemisphere winter in the period January 1997 to December 2017. We verify the representation of these WCB stages in terms of systematic occurrence frequency biases, forecast reliability, and forecast skill. Systematic WCB frequency biases emerge already at early lead times of around 3 days with an underestimation for the WCB outflow over the North Atlantic and eastern North Pacific of around 40\% relative to climatology. Biases in the predictor variables of the logistic regression models can partially explain these biases in WCB inflow, ascent, or outflow. Despite an overconfidence in predicting high WCB probabilities, skillful WCB forecasts are on average possible up to a lead time of 8–10 days with more skill over the North Pacific compared to the North Atlantic region. Our results corroborate that the current limited forecast skill for the large-scale extratropical circulation on subseasonal time scales beyond 10 days might be tied to the representation of WCBs and associated upscale error growth.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, there has been growing evidence that latent heat release in midlatitude weather systems such as warm conveyor belts (WCBs) contributes significantly to the onset and maintenance of blocking anticyclones (blocked weather regimes). Still, numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models struggle to correctly predict and represent atmospheric blocking in particular over Europe. Here, we elucidate the representation of WCB activity in 20~years of extended winter (1997–2017) of European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecast's IFS reforecasts around the onset of blocking over Europe (EuBL) employing different perspectives. First, we show that the model struggles to predict EuBL onsets already at 10–14~days lead time in line with a misrepresentation of WCB activity in the ensemble mean. However, we also find cases with accurate EuBL forecasts even in pentad 4 (15–19~days). This subset of successful forecasts at extended‐range lead times goes in line with accurate WCB forecasts over the North Atlantic several days prior to the blocking onset. Second, investigating the time‐lagged relationship of blocking onset and WCB activity, we find that WCB activity over the North Atlantic emerges well prior to the onset of the block and that different pathways into EuBL exist in the reforecasts compared to reanalysis. Finally, we find indication of predictability associated with a Rossby wave train emerging from the North Pacific. Although our study can not disentangle the roles of intrinsic predictability limits and model deficiencies, we show that correct predictions of EuBL go along with distinct patterns of WCB activity.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) are weather systems associated with low pressure systems which occur predominantly over the ocean regions of the midlatitudes. Several recent studies highlight the role of latent heat release due to cloud formation~in WCBs for the development of long‐lived high pressure systems. However, current weather prediction and climate models struggle to accurately predict these high pressure systems, particularly over Europe (EuBL). This study, based on 20~years (1997–2017) of forecast data, reveals challenges in predicting WCB activity together with the onset of EuBL, especially within a lead time of 10–14~days. Successful predictions at extended lead times (15–19~days) align with precise forecasts of WCB activity over the North Atlantic and North Pacific, indicating a connection between these regions. Examining the timing of the onset of EuBL and WCB activity, we show that WCB activity over the North Atlantic precedes EuBL. Additionally, we identify both correct and incorrect pathways leading to EuBL and suggest that predictability of EuBL may arise from specific atmospheric patterns, particularly related to Rossby waves in the North Pacific.           ,              Key Points                                                                Warm conveyor belt (WCB) activity around the onset of atmospheric blocking over Europe (EuBL) is analyzed in reanalysis and sub‐seasonal reforecasts                                                     Correct WCB prediction provides a sub‐seasonal window of forecast opportunity for EuBL onset                                                     Synoptic activity over the North Pacific supports the development of a teleconnection that affects EuBL onset},

First, the comparisons between the DOWN and ETKF schemes reveal that they behave differently in many ways. Specifically, the ensemble spread and forecast error for precipitation in the DOWN scheme are larger than those in the ETKF; the probabilistic forecasting skill for precipitation in the DOWN scheme is better than that in the ETKF at small neighborhood radii, whereas the advantages of the ETKF begin to appear as the neighborhood radius increases; DOWN possesses better spread–skill relationships than ETKF and has comparable probabilistic forecasting skills for nonprecipitation. Second, the comparisons between DOWN and ETKF\_LARGE indicate that the differences in the large-scale initial perturbation components are key to the differences between DOWN and ETKF. Third, the comparisons between ETKF and ETKF\_LARGE demonstrate that the small-scale initial perturbations are important since they can increase the precipitation spread in the early times and decrease the forecast errors while simultaneously improving the probabilistic forecasting skill for precipitation. Given the advantages of the DOWN and ETKF schemes and the importance of both large-scale and small-scale initial perturbations, multiscale initial perturbations should be constructed in future research.},

We determine statistical results relating the structures of evolved errors to singular vectors (SVs), Lyapunov vectors (LVs) and finitetime normal modes (FTNMs). The statistics of 100 evolved error fields are studied for six day periods or longer and compared with the growth and structures of leading fast growing SVs, LVs and FTNMs. The SVs are studied in the kinetic energy (KE), enstrophy (EN) and streamfunction (SF) norms, while all FTNMs and the first LV are norm independent. The mean of the largest pattern correlations between the 100 error fields and dynamical vectors, taken over the five fastest growing SVs, in any of the three norms, or over the five fastest growing FTNMs, increases with increasing time interval to a value close to 0.6 after six days. Corresponding pattern correlations with the five fastest growing LVs are slightly lower. The leading dynamical vectors (SVs 1, FTNM1 or LV 1) generally, but not always, give the largest pattern correlations with the error fields. It is found that viscosity slightly increases the average correlations between the evolved errors and LV 1 and evolved SVs 1. Mean pattern correlations with fast growing dynamical vectors increase further for time intervals longer than six days.},

  abstract = {Persistent hot–dry or cold–wet summer weather can have significant impacts on agriculture, health, and the environment. For northwestern Europe, these weather regimes are typically linked to, respectively, blocked or zonal jet stream states. The fundamental dynamics underlying these circulation states are still poorly understood. Edward Lorenz postulated that summer circulation may be either fully or almost intransitive, implying that part of the phase space (capturing circulation variability) cannot be reached within one specific summer. If true, this would have major implications for the predictability of summer weather and our understanding of the drivers of interannual variability of summer weather. Here, we test the two Lorenz hypotheses (i.e., fully or almost intransitive) for European summer circulation, capitalizing on a newly available very large ensemble (2000 years) of present-day climate data in the fully coupled global climate model EC-Earth. Using self-organizing maps, we quantify the phase space of summer circulation and the trajectories through phase space in unprecedented detail. We show that, based on Markov assumptions, the summer circulation is strongly dependent on its initial state in early summer with the atmospheric memory ranging from 28 days up to ;45 days. The memory is particularly long if the initial state is either a blocked or a zonal flow state. Furthermore, we identify two groups of summers that are characterized by distinctly different trajectories through phase space, and that prefer either a blocked or zonal circulation state, respectively. These results suggest that intransitivity is indeed a fundamental property of the atmosphere and an important driver of interannual variability.},

Our approach is inspired by the dynamical system concept of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) and motivated by the potential practical utility in modeling the circulation as a sequence of short-lived but well-defined trajectories. Here, we identify the dominant spatiotemporal preferred trajectories in a large ensemble (2000-yr) of simulated present-day climate data with a multistage clustering algorithm. Unlike conventional regime definitions based solely on spatial patterns, our method also explicitly takes into account the temporal trajectory through phase space. We find that 13 spatiotemporal clusters together capture over 80\% of the circulation dynamics over the Euro-Atlantic domain. We distinguish between clusters with a quasistationary tendency and clusters with a transient tendency. Markov transition probabilities between the clusters reveal that the circulation tends to alternate between quasistationary and transient episodes, instead of transitioning between quasistationary clusters directly. We show that traversing the phase space between quasistationary blocking and southerly shifted zonal jet states takes at least 10–15 days and that trajectories tend to stay close to these states in phase space for prolonged periods. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal clusters capture a diverse range of well-known circulation regimes while also revealing more nuanced behavioral characteristics of the Euro-Atlantic summer circulation.},

  abstract = {The finite resolution of general circulation models of the coupled atmosphere–ocean system and the effects of sub-grid-scale variability present a major source of uncertainty in model simulations on all time scales. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts has been at the forefront of developing new approaches to account for these uncertainties. In particular, the stochastically perturbed physical tendency scheme and the stochastically perturbed backscatter algorithm for the atmosphere are now used routinely for global numerical weather prediction. The European Centre also performs long-range predictions of the coupled atmosphere–ocean climate system in operational forecast mode, and the latest seasonal forecasting system—System 4—has the stochastically perturbed tendency and backscatter schemes implemented in a similar way to that for the medium-range weather forecasts. Here, we present results of the impact of these schemes in System 4 by contrasting the operational performance on seasonal time scales during the retrospective forecast period 1981–2010 with comparable simulations that do not account for the representation of model uncertainty. We find that the stochastic tendency perturbation schemes helped to reduce excessively strong convective activity especially over the Maritime Continent and the tropical Western Pacific, leading to reduced biases of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), cloud cover, precipitation and near-surface winds. Positive impact was also found for the statistics of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), showing an increase in the frequencies and amplitudes of MJO events. Further, the errors of El Niño southern oscillation forecasts become smaller, whereas increases in ensemble spread lead to a better calibrated system if the stochastic tendency is activated. The backscatter scheme has overall neutral impact. Finally, evidence for noise-activated regime transitions has been found in a cluster analysis of mid-latitude circulation regimes over the Pacific–North America region.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Many fundamental concepts of synoptic-scale extratropical dynamics are based on the quasi-geostrophic equations of a dry atmosphere. This “dry dynamics” provides the essential understanding of, for example, the formation of extratropical cyclones and the propagation of Rossby waves and makes potential vorticity~(PV) a materially conserved quantity. Classically, for extratropical weather systems, the importance of so-called “diabatic effects”, e.g.~surface fluxes, phase changes of water in clouds, and radiation, has been regarded as secondary compared to the dry dynamical processes. As outlined in this review article, research during recent decades has modified this view of the role of diabatic processes. A combination of complementary research approaches revealed that the nonlinear dynamics of extratropical cyclones and upper-tropospheric Rossby waves is affected – in some cases strongly – by diabatic processes. Despite the violation of material PV~conservation in the presence of diabatic processes, the concept of~PV has been of utmost importance to identify and quantify the role of diabatic processes and to integrate their effects into the classical understanding based on dry dynamics. This review first summarises the theoretical concepts of diabatic~PV modification, moist~PV, and slantwise moist convection and provides a concise overview of early research on diabatic effects until the late 1970s. Two poorly predicted high-impact cyclones affecting eastern North America then triggered an impressive diversity of efforts to investigate the role of diabatic processes in rapid cyclone intensification in the last 2~decades of the 20th~century. These research activities, including the development of sophisticated diagnostics, growing applications of the Lagrangian perspective, real-case and idealised numerical experiments, and dedicated field experiments, are reviewed in detail. This historical perspective provides insight about how societal relevance, international collaboration, technical development, and creative science contributed to establishing this important theme of dynamical meteorology. The second part of the review then more selectively outlines important achievements in the last 2~decades in our understanding of how diabatic effects, in particular those related to cloud microphysics, affect the structure, dynamics, and predictability of different types of extratropical cyclones and their mesoscale substructures, upper-tropospheric blocks, Rossby waves, and interactions. A novel aspect is the relevance of research on diabatic processes for climate change research. The review closes by highlighting important implications of investigating diabatic processes in extratropical weather systems for the broader field of weather and climate dynamics and its fundamentals and representation in numerical models.},

The analysis is performed both in hemispheric and sectoral domains of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Patterns characterized as “pulsing” and “latitudinal shifting” of the climatological-mean storm tracks emerge as the leading sectoral patterns of variability. Based on the analysis presented, storm-track variability on the spatial scale of the two Northern Hemisphere sectors appears to be largely, but perhaps not completely, independent.             Pulsing and latitudinally shifting storm tracks are accompanied by zonal wind anomalies consistent with eddy-forced accelerations and geopotential height anomalies that project strongly on the dominant patterns of geopotential height variability. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)–Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) is associated with a pulsing of the Atlantic storm track and a meridional displacement of the upper-tropospheric jet exit region, whereas the eastern Atlantic (EA) pattern is associated with a latitudinally shifting storm track and an extension or retraction of the upper-tropospheric jet. Analogous patterns of storm-track and upper-tropospheric jet variability are associated with the western Pacific (WP) and Pacific–North America (PNA) patterns. Wave–mean flow relationships shown here are more clearly defined than in previous studies and are shown to extend through the depth of the troposphere. The Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) is associated with a latitudinally shifting storm track over the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans and a pulsing South Pacific storm track. The patterns of storm-track variability are shown to be related to simple distortions of the climatological-mean upper-tropospheric jet.},

This estimator does not depend on a formal model of the structure of the heteroskedasticity. By comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator, one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity, since in the absence of heteroskedasticity, the two estimators will be approximately equal, but will generally diverge otherwise. The test has an appealing least squares interpretation.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The detection of finite-time coherent particle sets in Lagrangian trajectory data, using data-clustering techniques, is an active research field at the moment. Yet, the clustering methods mostly employed so far have been based on graph partitioning, which assigns each trajectory to a cluster, i.e. there is no concept of noisy, incoherent trajectories. This is problematic for applications in the ocean, where many small, coherent eddies are present in a large, mostly noisy fluid flow. Here, for the first time in this context, we use the density-based clustering algorithm of OPTICS (ordering points to identify the clustering structure;~Ankerst et~al.,~1999) to detect finite-time coherent particle sets in Lagrangian trajectory data. Different from partition-based clustering methods, derived clustering results contain a concept of noise, such that not every trajectory needs to be part of a cluster. OPTICS also has a major advantage compared to the previously used density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method, as it can detect clusters of varying density. The resulting clusters have an intrinsically hierarchical structure, which allows one to detect coherent trajectory sets at different spatial scales at once. We apply OPTICS directly to Lagrangian trajectory data in the Bickley jet model flow and successfully detect the expected vortices and the jet. The resulting clustering separates the vortices and the jet from background noise, with an imprint of the hierarchical clustering structure of coherent, small-scale vortices in a coherent, large-scale background flow. We then apply our method to a set of virtual trajectories released in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean in an eddying ocean model and successfully detect Agulhas rings. We illustrate the difference between our approach and partition-based k-means clustering using a 2D embedding of the trajectories derived from classical multidimensional scaling. We also show how OPTICS can be applied to the spectral embedding of a trajectory-based network to overcome the problems of k-means spectral clustering in detecting Agulhas rings.},

  abstract = {In climate simulations, the impacts of the subgrid scales on the resolved scales are conventionally represented using deterministic closure schemes, which assume that the impacts are uniquely determined by the resolved scales. Stochastic parameterization relaxes this assumption, by sampling the subgrid variability in a computationally inexpensive manner. This study shows that the simulated climatological state of the ocean is improved in many respects by implementing a simple stochastic parameterization of ocean eddies into a coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model. Simulations from a highresolution, eddy-permitting ocean model are used to calculate the eddy statistics needed to inject realistic stochastic noise into a low-resolution, non-eddy-permitting version of the same model. A suite of four stochastic experiments is then run to test the sensitivity of the simulated climate to the noise definition by varying the noise amplitude and decorrelation time within reasonable limits. The addition of zero-mean noise to the ocean temperature tendency is found to have a nonzero effect on the mean climate. Specifically, in terms of the ocean temperature and salinity fields both at the surface and at depth, the noise reduces many of the biases in the low-resolution model and causes it to more closely resemble the highresolution model. The variability of the strength of the global ocean thermohaline circulation is also improved. It is concluded that stochastic ocean perturbations can yield reductions in climate model error that are comparable to those obtained by refining the resolution, but without the increased computational cost. Therefore, stochastic parameterizations of ocean eddies have the potential to significantly improve climate simulations.},

  abstract = {Rossby wave packets (RWPs) are Rossby waves for which the amplitude has a local maximum and decays to smaller values at larger distances. This review focuses on upper-tropospheric transient RWPs along the midlatitude jet stream. Their central characteristic is the propagation in the zonal direction as well as the transfer of wave energy from one individual trough or ridge to its downstream neighbor, a process called ‘‘downstream development.’’ These RWPs sometimes act as long-range precursors to extreme weather and presumably have an influence on the predictability of midlatitude weather systems. The paper reviews research progress in this area with an emphasis on developments during the last 15 years. The current state of knowledge is summarized including a discussion of the RWP life cycle as well as Rossby waveguides. Recent progress in the dynamical understanding of RWPs has been based, in part, on the development of diagnostic methods. These methods include algorithms to identify and track RWPs in an automated manner, which can be used to extract the climatological properties of RWPs. RWP dynamics have traditionally been investigated using the eddy kinetic energy framework; alternative approaches based on potential vorticity and wave activity fluxes are discussed and put into perspective with the more traditional approach. The different diagnostics are compared to each other and the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods are highlighted. A recurrent theme is the role of diabatic processes, which can be a source for forecast errors. Finally, the paper points to important open research questions and suggests avenues for future research.},

This study explores the sensitivity of this hybrid forecast to its parameter choices and compares its skill in forecasting extreme rainfall events in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam to that of the Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS). The hybrid forecast is found to outperform both the global and convection‐permitting ensemble in some regions when forecasting the most extreme events; however, for less extreme events, the ensemble is found more skilful. A weighted blend of the MOGREPS forecasts and the hybrid forecast was found to have the highest skill of all for almost all definitions of extreme event and in most regions. To quantify the influence of errors in the predicted wave state on the skill of the hybrid forecast, the skill of a hypothetical best‐case forecast was also calculated using reanalysis data to specify the wave amplitudes and phases. This best‐case forecast indicates that errors in the forecasts of all wave types reduce the skill of hybrid forecast; however, the reduction in skill is largest for Kelvin waves. The skill in convection‐permitting models is greater than for global models in the regions where Kelvin waves dominate, but the added value of limited‐area high‐resolution forecasts is hampered by the poor representation of Kelvin waves in the parent global model.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review Atmospheric blocking events represent some of the most high-impact weather patterns in the mid-latitudes, yet they have often been a cause for concern in future climate projections. There has been low confidence in predicted future changes in blocking, despite relatively good agreement between climate models on a decline in blocking. This is due to the lack of a comprehensive theory of blocking and a pervasive underestimation of blocking occurrence by models. This paper reviews the state of knowledge regarding blocking under climate change, with the aim of providing an overview for those working in related fields. Recent Findings Several avenues have been identified by which blocking can be improved in numerical models, though a fully reliable simulation remains elusive (at least, beyond a few days lead time). Models are therefore starting to provide some useful information on how blocking and its impacts may change in the future, although deeper understanding of the processes at play will be needed to increase confidence in model projections. There are still major uncertainties regarding the processes most important to the onset, maintenance and decay of blocking and advances in our understanding of atmospheric dynamics, for example in the role of diabatic processes, continue to inform the modelling and prediction efforts.},

Here we focus on the Atlantic–European sector, and on the effects of greenhouse gas forcing on the atmospheric and, to a lesser extent, oceanic circulations. We review the dynamical processes which shape European climate and then consider how each of these leads to uncertainty in the future climate. European climate is unique in many regards, and as such it poses a unique challenge for climate prediction. Future European climate must be considered particularly uncertain because (i) the spread between the predictions of current climate models is still considerable and (ii) Europe is particularly strongly affected by several processes which are known to be poorly represented in current models.},

  abstract = {This study delves into the predictability of atmospheric blocking, zonal, and transition patterns utilizing a simplified coupled model. This model, implemented in Python, emulates midlatitude atmospheric dynamics with a two-layer quasigeostrophic channel atmosphere on a beta-plane, encompassing simplified land effects. Initially, we comprehensively scrutinize the model’s responses to environmental parameters like solar radiation, surface friction, and atmosphere-ground heat exchange. 5 Our findings confirm that the model faithfully replicates real-world Earth-like flow regimes, establishing a robust foundation for further analysis. Subsequently, employing Gaussian mixture clustering, we successfully delineate distinct blocking, zonal, and transition flow regimes, unveiling their dependencies on surface friction. To gauge predictability and persistence, we compute the averaged local Lyapunov exponents for each regime. Our investigation uncovers the presence of zonal, blocking, and transition regimes, particularly under conditions of reduced surface friction. As surface friction increases further, the system 10 transitions to a state characterized by two blocking regimes and a transition regime. Intriguingly, periodic behavior emerges under specific surface friction values, returning to patterns observed under low friction coefficients. Model resolution increase impacts the system in a way that only two regimes are then obtained with the clustering: the transition phase disappears and the predictability drops to roughly 2 days for both of the remaining regimes. In accordance with previous research findings, our study underscores that when all three regimes coexist, zonal patterns exhibit a more extended predictability horizon compared 15 to blocking patterns. Remarkably, transition patterns exhibit reduced predictability when coexisting with the other regimes. In addition, within a specified range of surface friction values where two blocking regimes are found, it is observed that blocked atmospheric situations in the west of the applied topography are marked by instabilities and reduced predictability in contrast to the blockings appearing on the eastern side of the topography.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Although conventionally attributed to dry dynamics, increasing evidence points to a key role of moist dynamics in the formation and maintenance of blocking events. The source of moisture crucial for these processes, however, remains elusive. In this study, we identify the moisture sources responsible for latent heating associated with the wintertime Euro-Atlantic blocking events detected over 31~years (1979–2010). To this end, we track atmospheric particles backward in time from the blocking centres for a period of 10\,d using an offline Lagrangian dispersion model applied to atmospheric reanalysis data. The analysis reveals that 28\,\%–55\,\% of particles gain heat and moisture from the ocean over the course of 10\,d, with higher percentages for the lower altitudes from which particles are released. Via large-scale ascent, these moist particles transport low-potential-vorticity (PV) air of low-altitude, low-latitude origins into the upper troposphere, where the amplitude of blocking is the most prominent, in agreement with previous studies. The PV of these moist particles remains significantly lower compared to their dry counterparts throughout the course of 10\,d, preferentially constituting blocking cores. Further analysis reveals that approximately two-thirds of the moist particles source their moisture locally from the Atlantic, while the remaining one-third of moist particles source it from the Pacific. There is also a small fraction of moist particles that take up moisture from both the Pacific and Atlantic basins, which undergo a large-scale uplift over the Atlantic using moisture picked up over both basins. The Gulf Stream and Kuroshio and their extensions as well as the eastern Pacific northeast of Hawaii not only provide heat and moisture to moist particles but also act as “springboards” for their large-scale, cross-isentropic ascent, where its extent strongly depends on the humidity content at the time of the ascent. While the particles of Atlantic origin swiftly ascend just before their arrival at blocking, those of Pacific origin begin their ascent a few days earlier, after which they carry low-PV air in the upper troposphere while undergoing radiative cooling just as dry particles. A previous study identified a blocking maintenance mechanism, whereby low-PV air is selectively absorbed into blocking systems to prolong blocking lifetime. As they used an isentropic trajectory analysis, this mechanism was regarded as a dry process. We found that these moist particles that are fuelled over the Pacific can also act to maintain blocks in the same manner, revealing that what appears to be a blocking maintenance mechanism governed by dry dynamics alone can, in fact, be of moist origin.},

According to this mechanism, which is based on vortex–vortex interactions (i.e., the interactions between a blocking anticyclone and synoptic eddies with the same polarity), a blocking anticyclone actively and selectively absorbs synoptic anticyclones (strictly, air parcels with low potential vorticity). The blocking anticyclone, which is thus supplied with low potential vorticity of the synoptic anticyclones, can subsist for a prolonged period, withstanding dissipation.             The SAM was verified in a case study through trajectory analysis. Ten actual cases of blocking were examined. Trajectories were calculated by tracing parcels originating from synoptic anticyclones and cyclones located upstream of the blocking. Parcels starting from anticyclones were attracted to and absorbed by the blocking anticyclone, whereas parcels from cyclones were repelled by the blocking anticyclone and attracted to the blocking cyclone, if one was present.             The results show that the SAM is effective in the maintenance of observed cases of blocking. In addition, the uniqueness and distinction of the SAM from other previously proposed maintenance mechanisms are discussed.},

The second half of this review focuses on observable chaos, characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents on positive Lebesgue measure sets. Much attention is given to SRB measures, a very special kind of invariant measures that offer a way to understand observable chaos in dissipative systems. Paradoxical as it may seem, given a concrete system, it is generally impossible to determine with mathematical certainty if it has observable chaos unless strong geometric conditions are satisfied; case studies will be discussed. The final section is on noisy or stochastically perturbed systems, for which we present a dynamical picture simpler than that for purely deterministic systems. In this short review, we have elected to limit ourselves to finite-dimensional systems and to discrete time. The phase space, which is assumed to be Rd or a Riemannian manifold, is denoted by M throughout. The Lebesgue or the Riemannian measure on M is denoted by m, and the dynamics are generated by iterating a self-map of M, written f : M  . For flows, the reviewed results are applicable to time-t maps and Poincar ́ e return maps to cross-sections.},

Here, we upscaled and analysed two decades (2002–2021) of Boreal–Arctic wetland CH4 emissions, representing an unprecedented compilation of eddy covariance and chamber observations. We found a robust increasing trend of CH4 emissions (+8.9\%) with strong inter-annual variability. The majority of emission increases occurred in early summer (June and July) and were mainly driven by warming (52.3\%) and ecosystem productivity (40.7\%). Moreover, a 2\,°C temperature anomaly in 2016 led to the highest recorded annual CH4 emissions (22.3\,Tg\,CH4\,yr−1) over this region, driven primarily by high emissions over Western Siberian lowlands. However, current-generation models from the Global Carbon Project failed to capture the emission magnitude and trend, and may bias the estimates in future wetland CH4 emission driven by amplified Boreal–Arctic warming and greening.},

In our analysis, we account for the social and economic shocks triggered by COVID-19 and their relative impacts on the SDGs. We also analyze the interconnections between SDG indicators during the pandemic to assess the indirect cascading effects of COVID-19 on the SDGs. We find that these indirect effects slowed progress much more than the direct initial disruptions. Globally, poverty eradication (SDG 1) is most affected by the pandemic. Regionally, SDG progress has been set back most in Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. We suggest that for high and upper-middle-income countries a focus on reducing inequality (SDG 10) would be most beneficial, whereas for low-income and lower-middle-income countries industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9) are a priority in the post-COVID-19 phase.},

However, there is a lack of systematic and quantitative research to explore how this field has evolved over time. In this study, the methods of text mining and bibliometric analysis were combined to address this shortcoming. The results showed that there were clear periodical characteristics in IHS studies between 1986 and 2019. High-frequency words, e.g., catchment, stable isotope, runoff, groundwater, precipitation, runoff generation, and soil, were the basic topics in IHS studies. Forest and glacier/snow were the main landscapes in this research field. ‘Variation’, ‘spatial’, and ‘uncertainty’ are hot issues for future research. Today, studies involving the geographical source, flow path, and transit/residence time of streamflow components have enhanced our understanding of the hydrological processes by using hydrometeorological measurements, water chemistry, and stable isotope approaches. In the future, new methods, such as path analysis and ensemble hydrograph separation, should be verified and used in more regions, especially in remote and mountainous areas. Additionally, the understanding of the role of surface water in streamflow components remains limited and should be deeply studied in the future.},

This paper presents a detailed approach which relies on a more realistic ‘human body’ shape and accounts for the variability in time of both the wind and the raindrop size and velocity distributions. It appears that in some seldom cases with tailwind and light rain, there is an optimum velocity, but in general it is better to run as fast as possible.

  abstract = {Abstract             In numerical weather prediction models, near‐surface quantities like 10‐m wind speed (FF10M) or 2‐m temperature (T2M) tend to exhibit significantly larger forecast errors than the related variables in the free troposphere. Besides representativeness issues of surface stations, this is primarily related to parametrization errors and insufficient knowledge of relevant physical properties of the soil and the surface layer. For instance, the vegetation roughness length is usually derived from land‐cover classifications that may contain errors and reflect only part of the natural variability. This article describes a methodology implemented into Deutscher Wetterdienst's operational numerical weather prediction model ICON in order to improve the estimate of such parameters by using information from the data assimilation system. Building upon the condition that FF10M, T2M, and 2‐m relative humidity are assimilated, time‐filtered assimilation increments are calculated for the respective fields at the lowest model level. These are taken as proxies for the related model biases. For T2M, an additional weighted increment field is computed that indicates the model bias in the diurnal temperature amplitude. Based on these increment fields, several physical parameter fields and a few model tuning parameters are varied around their base values. This adaptive parameter adjustment is used operationally in the global and regional forecasting systems of Deutscher Wetterdienst. The ensuing reduction of the FF10M, T2M, and 2‐m relative humidity errors typically lies on the order of 5\% on a hemispheric average but has substantial regional and seasonal variability that depends on the original magnitude of the model error. A weaker but still statistically significant positive impact is seen in the radiosonde verification of wind speed, humidity, and temperature in the lower troposphere, giving confidence that the adaptive tuning indeed reduces model errors rather than pushing the model towards unrepresentative station observations.},

  abstract = {A recent study examined the predictability of an idealized baroclinic wave amplifying in a conditionally unstable atmosphere through numerical simulations with parameterized moist convection. It was demonstrated that with the effect of moisture included, the error starting from small random noise is characterized by upscale growth in the short-term (0–36 h) forecast of a growing synoptic-scale disturbance. The current study seeks to explore further the mesoscale error-growth dynamics in idealized moist baroclinic waves through convection-permitting experiments with model grid increments down to 3.3 km. These experiments suggest the following three-stage error-growth model: in the initial stage, the errors grow from small-scale convective instability and then quickly [O(1 h)] saturate at the convective scales. In the second stage, the character of the errors changes from that of convective-scale unbalanced motions to one more closely related to large-scale balanced motions. That is, some of the error from convective scales is retained in the balanced motions, while the rest is radiated away in the form of gravity waves. In the final stage, the large-scale (balanced) components of the errors grow with the background baroclinic instability. Through examination of the error-energy budget, it is found that buoyancy production due mostly to moist convection is comparable to shear production (nonlinear velocity advection). It is found that turning off latent heating not only dramatically decreases buoyancy production, but also reduces shear production to less than 20\% of its original amplitude.},

This predictability limit is studied using unprecedented high-resolution global models with ensemble experiments of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF; 9-km operational model) and identical-twin experiments of the U.S. Next-Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS; 3 km). Results suggest that the predictability limit for midlatitude weather may indeed exist and is intrinsic to the underlying dynamical system and instabilities even if the forecast model and the initial conditions are nearly perfect. Currently, a skillful forecast lead time of midlatitude instantaneous weather is around 10 days, which serves as the practical predictability limit. Reducing the current-day initial-condition uncertainty by an order of magnitude extends the deterministic forecast lead times of day-to-day weather by up to 5 days, with much less scope for improving prediction of small-scale phenomena like thunderstorms. Achieving this additional predictability limit can have enormous socioeconomic benefits but requires coordinated efforts by the entire community to design better numerical weather models, to improve observations, and to make better use of observations with advanced data assimilation and computing techniques.},

Although many climaterelated disasters are caused by compound events, the understanding, analysis, quantification and prediction of such events is still in its infancy. In this Review, we propose a typology of compound events and suggest analytical and modelling approaches to aid in their investigation. We organize the highly diverse compound event types according to four themes: preconditioned, where a weather-driven or climate-driven precondition aggravates the impacts of a hazard; multivariate, where multiple drivers and/or hazards lead to an impact; temporally compounding, where a succession of hazards leads to an impact; and spatially compounding, where hazards in multiple connected locations cause an aggregated impact. Through structuring compound events and their respective analysis tools, the typology offers an opportunity for deeper insight into their mechanisms and impacts, benefiting the development of effective adaptation strategies. However, the complex nature of compound events results in some cases inevitably fitting into more than one class, necessitating soft boundaries within the typology. Future work must homogenize the available analytical approaches into a robust toolset for compound-event analysis under present and future climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This study presents a Lagrangian analysis of upper-tropospheric anticyclones that are connected to surface heat waves in different European regions for the period~1979 to~2016. In order to elucidate the formation of these anticyclones and the role of diabatic processes, we trace air parcels backwards from the upper-tropospheric anticyclones and quantify the diabatic heating in these air parcels. Around 25\,\%–45\,\% of the air parcels are diabatically heated during the last 3\,d prior to their arrival in the upper-tropospheric anticyclones, and this amount increases to 35\,\%–50\,\% for the last 7\,d. The influence of diabatic heating is larger for heat-wave-related anticyclones in northern Europe and western Russia and smaller in southern Europe. Interestingly, the diabatic heating occurs in two geographically separated air streams; 3\,d prior to arrival, one heating branch (remote branch) is located above the western North Atlantic, and the other heating branch (nearby branch) is located over northwestern Africa and Europe to the southwest of the target upper-tropospheric anticyclone. The diabatic heating in the remote branch is related to warm conveyor belts in North Atlantic cyclones upstream of the evolving upper-level ridge. In contrast, the nearby branch is diabatically heated by convection, as indicated by elevated mixed-layer convective available potential energy along the western side of the matured upper-level ridge. Most European regions are influenced by both branches, whereas western Russia is predominantly affected by the nearby branch. The remote branch predominantly affects the formation of the upper-tropospheric anticyclone, and therefore of the heat wave, whereas the nearby branch is more active during its maintenance. For long-lasting heat waves, the remote branch regenerates. The results from this study show that the dynamical processes leading to heat waves may be sensitive to small-scale microphysical and convective processes, whose accurate representation in models is thus supposed to be crucial for heat wave predictions on weather and climate timescales.},
